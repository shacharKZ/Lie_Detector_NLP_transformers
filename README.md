# Transformers Based Lie Detectors: Deceptive Opinions Detection Using Transformers on Single and Multiple Domains
## Lie_Detector_NLP_transformers

The project was made for the **097215 Natural Language Processing** course at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.

_lie_detector.py_ - running the experiment mention in our paper: **"Transformers Based Lie Detectors: Deceptive Opinions Detection Using Transformers on Single and Multiple Domains"**. the results of this experiment are output into txt files which we parse into an Excel (csv) file using _parser_results.py_ .
_create_mix_files.py_ - scripts for creating our datasets.
