"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling.",TRUE

In addition, Spiegelman notes that the author has a very good knowledge of the history of the period",FALSE

One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).

"This book was a recommendation of my reading group. Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.

I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight.

"I bought the Inferno somewhat reluctantly because of all the negative reviews.  But since I have loved all of Brown's previous books, it seemed worth a chance. I am an avid reader of nonfiction - have a library of thousands - and occasionally read fiction recreationally. Brown is one of the few fiction writers that I enjoy, because he so elequently sets the scene of his stories, and describes the locations in great depth. These are usually places that I will never see, but definitely would have, if the circumstances of my life had been different. It seems that this has been a problem for many reviewers, but for me, it is one of the many reasons that Brown's books never fail to enchant me.

The next issue that appears to have bothered some reviewers was the topic of overpopulation.  This has been addressed often by scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, among others, and yet I don't hear it discussed among the general population as more than a passing topic. It is as though the subject is of no concern to most people. But to make it the subject of a novel, by such a renowned writer, people will become more aware, and perhaps even research the issue... and who knows...  even do something about it.

That was what I experienced when The DaVinci Code was on the best seller lists. Everywhere I went people were talking about it. Some were appalled by the ideas Brown put forth, but many were fascinated by the ideas and were researching the early Christian era to find out more about it.

I have always had an interest in the Divine Comedy, and so, really appreciated reading a novel that featured it so highly. Also, Brown certainly had me on the edge of my seat with all the dramatic chase scenes and all the unknowns such as his amnesia.

All in all, I have to say that I loved the book and will probably read it again, as well as recommend itto others.",TRUE
"Having read and thoroughly enjoying Bernstein's earlier biography of Thomas Jefferson, I decided to give THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS, a look. Like his earlier work, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson, however this book is geared towards the school age reader. Much of the text is identical to the earlier biography. The most significant difference is the addition of dozens of illustrations, from portraits of Jefferson's friends, family, and foes, and political cartoons. My single knock on Bernstein's book is the same knock I had on his previous work. Bernstein adamantly portrays Jefferson as a ""strict separationist"", which in and of itself is accurate. However he fails to recognize that what constituted a ""strict separationist"" 200 years ago is much different than the definition given in today's climate of political correctness gone awry. Bernstein seems genuinely perplexed that Jefferson ""sent Christian missionaries to establish schools in western territories to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity. "" As with extremists today, Bernstein fails to understand that Jefferson's actions did not violate the First Amendment in that ""Congress made no law respecting the establishment of religion. ""

I could spend all day writing about how mixed up people are about what the First Amendment means and how it was intended by our framers, but that strays from the subject at hand. All in all, this is a great introduction for school children and should capture their interest and perhaps, lead them into more indepth study of one of our greatest leaders. Monty Rainey

"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.

"I am assuming that if you are reading this review you have at least read the synopsis of the book and know what the story is about so instead of summarizing I am going to list the things I did and did not like.

The good:

-The characters are great. They are charming and funny and I love that they focus so much on  family obligation

-The authors paint a wonderful picture of small town life

-There is a mixture of humor and more serious things going on within the story.

The not so good:

-There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. A lot of mixed up he/she. There were also times that words were used in an unrealistic way. I don't think any woman has ever thought that she would like to feel a mans cock against her integument, though that is just my opinion.

-There was tons of unnecessary details given. I don't need to know that he turned the shower on, then checked the temp, then got in, then picked out a shampoo, then picked out a body wash and on and on it goes. The story could have been cut in half without losing anything of importance.

-pov jumped around a lot which is usually good but there was no real flow to it.

-There was just too much going on. The focus should have been primarily on Quinn and Mhisery with Chance getting his own book. The little glimpses of other people seemed out of place as well.

-It often felt like rather than reading a story things were being ""explained"" and there was too much repetition and even some inconsistency. He goes down on her at one point and then later is surprised that she is pierced there?

These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym.

One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) that has one of Buddy's classic solos.  This sequence alone makes the DVD worth getting. An added bonus is the included soundtrack on CD that comes with the DVD.

"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area.",TRUE

"I received a defective unit (zoom lens stopped working after an hour), and have had the replacement since December, 2015.  So far, everything is working as of February 7, 2016.  The design and features of this camera are impressive.  There are so many functions and modes that it would be hard to learn all of them, but the layout and menu are such that it is easy to access the features you will need and use, and there are 5 buttons that can be programmed to access your most used menu features.  The only ""cons"" I would mention are:
(1) There is a slight motor noise present as soon as the camera is turned on.  Panasonic says this is normal and needed to support the Image Stabilization, Focus and Zoom functions, but this noise is picked up by the built-in stereo mike during video recording modes.  I wonder about the life of a motor that's on all the time.

I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

"My dogs are fairly rough on toys - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both).

This ball is not solid, and it is not durable.

The ball looks exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category.",TRUE

"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it!

Let me start out by stating I bought this as a gift for my brother. It gets points for the outside appearance and the fact that it has actual glass and not cheap plastic. The latch is okay. It does the job but could be improved in quality.  On the inside the is where it appears cheap to me and how you hve to set up the dividers.  I think they were aiming for you to be able to customize the set up but it comes off cheap to me. The dividers feel like the re little more than felt covered cardboard. Maybe I didn't read the discription fully I will have to recheck but I thought the diveiders were built in and that is why I was most disappointed.  I do like the fact that the cushions are removable because that mens you can store more than just watches in this case. It works well for almost any men's jewelry. I went ahead and gave three stars because if it wasn't for the dividers I would have been pleased with the purchase and maybe a better latch.  Needs to be better priced for what it is though.

"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!",TRUE

"I bought these despite a previous reviewer concerned with the ""cheap plastic"" not being able to ""dissipate heat"".  The  reason you SHOULD by these lights is because there's no heat to dissipate! That's the beauty of LED's: instead of making light and heat like the halogen lights we're replacing, LED's just make light, hence the energy savings. BTW., if the reviewer is that worried about heat dissipation, he should hurry up and get these because the old halogen lights in recessed ceiling cans get way to hot for my comfort level. Even the heat protection devises to make them safe for installation in attic spaces don't do that good of a job.

Not sure why he had such failure. I'm not sure if LED's can be used outside, in wet exposures. Curious to know how the guy who said they fit in the Malibu (exterior) lights from the boxed store are holding up! I hope well...these would save me a ton of money if I can replace those as well!!",TRUE

Skylar finds Rusty murdered in his own bed with her knife and all evidences clearly makes Skylar appear to be guilty therefore; she becomes a target for the Devil Kings MC.The author did an exceptional job with this novel and I love it. I connected very easily with the main characters. I found this book to be fast paced and really enjoyed the scenes between the two of them as they got more and more involved with each other as well as handling difficult situations.

Then when the ending came I thought it was well played out and very enjoyable. I highly recommend this story it's definitely a must read!!!",TRUE

"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right.",TRUE

"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside.

This was a pleasure to read. The amount of research the author did for this book is astounding. She didn't just take liberties on writing something in 1812 and do with it as she pleaded.

The main character was great in that she was consistent and stayed true to the time. Which I find greatly appreciated. And all of the side characters were wonderfully done as well.

Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!

"(Source: I receieved a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to author Kris Kreisman.)
Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

"This is a whole new way of looking at wood building and other projects. I also bought a fancy jig system, then realized this adhesive is the only thing I need. I lined the inside of a cabinet, fastened a dummy door pull to the closet, and added a 3/4 inch piece of wood to the bottom of a door in less than ten minutes. Very fast and very strong!
  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO.",TRUE

"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously.

He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind.",TRUE

Jase knows who ""Sammi"" is now. How did he find out ? Will he tell Dornan? Is he truly still the boy that Juliette loved, still loves? Is he on her side?

It was like I was holding my breath with Juliette waiting for Jase to figure it out. Then he does and I felt relief and then much like Juliette I felt despair at the consequences now that Jase knows. What a roller coaster ride of emotions!

Mira Grant is an excellent world builder. Adding more details to the story of how the Kellis-Amberlee virus was created and spread only made the possibility that something like that could really happen seem even more believable to me.

"When I heard there was going to be a Jurassic Park III, I thought it would suck. The ending to ""The Lost World"" was a great way to end the series. So I figured it would suck and give Jurassic Park a bad name. I was wrong. This one had the most action and was the most intense one in the series. I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts. For one example, the ending when the army and Navy showed up to rescue them. It was to unrelistic. The movie is still great though.

"This bicycle light mounted relatively easily to the handle bars of  my 20"" folding bike, but you do have to unscrew it totally to get it on.  The on/off button is easy to reach when riding.

I also was happy that the batteries were already installed when I took it out of the box, especially since it came with no instructions.  This light is bright enough for  me to be seen in the early evening.  I haven't used it at night yet but have tested it in a dark house and it is very bright.
The only little complaint is that you do have to totally unscrew the mount to take it off of the bike, and the little metal cylinder kept falling onto the ground.  Since I don't plan to take it off, I am thinking of adding a cable tie to make it more secure from theft.",TRUE

"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

"Loved it!!!

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's.

I picked it up because I thought it was some sort of crime novel and then it turned out to be about people - not my usual bag at all.

"This is the dictionary of bellydance- 2 discs- she goes through standing moves, traveling moves, veil and zill introductions, and some combinations.  Very useful and it is voiced over- she doesn't stop moving, the narration explains what she is doing.  I like how she doesn't dissect things to the point where you can't foresee what you trying to do.  She does the movements up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns.  Beautiful variety of costumes, Jehan illustrates that you don't have to have a model's figure to be a gorgeous sexy dancer- she is so beautiful!

I recomend that you also get 'the ultimate bellydance workout' with this dvd set because that dvd is fantastic and this set explains what the dancers in the other dvd are doing.  If you have the other and were discouraged because you couldn't quite get how they were doing certain moves, this dvd set explains it all.",TRUE

"First off, this kit's only intended for the 1st year class.  There is a tiny one-piece set that the kid can put together and then put back together.  In other words, it is a simple set of stairs, a one-piece set that is easy to assemble, and a 2-piece set that is very difficult.  So it is a little challenging for older kids to put together, but it is pretty easy for younger kids to put together.  The kit comes with a few parts that the kids can use, but they don't actually put them together.  So it's a little more challenging for older kids to put together.  It is also a little harder for younger kids to put together.  It is also a little more challenging for younger kids to put together.  The pieces are very small, so it is a little harder for them to put together.  Overall, this is a very educational set that is a good value for a 5-year-old.

"Who wouldn't love this patriotic little toy, the only thing I didn't like is the tiny one.

I had to get a replacement. The box was a mess. I sent it back and it still looks like it's broken. I wish it was a little bigger. The box is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. I wish it had a little more space. I just wish there was a little more space for the sound effects. It's very small. Overall it's a great little toy, but I would buy it again for my grandchildren.

I'm glad I found this seller, because I was disappointed in the quality. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was a huge fan. It is a great toy for an 8 year old. My son is a little older then I thought, but he loves to play with it. I don't recommend this toy to anyone but my grandchild.

My son loves this toy. My son is 4 and has had it for about a month now and it's been a hit! He's played with it more than any other toy I've purchased. He's also been able to play with it all the time and it's been great! I think it's perfect for little hands! I like that it comes with a small zipper that makes it easier for him to take it out of the bag and out of the bag. The zipper is sturdy and a great size for a 2 year old.

"FINALLY! I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for The Alpha King, but I know I've worked my way through a few versions of the Kindle since I first read The First Alpha!

I fell deeply in love with this series way back in 2013, and since then I've checked back every week for news on the sequel. Now it's here I know it was worth the wait! I fell in love with Thomas Smith from the first page, but when I realised who he was - and how he works into the world of the Five Tribes - I fell in love all over again. I don't want to give away the twist, but if you've read The First Alpha you'll be blown away when you... well, you'll know it when you see it :)

As for the romantic element, LOVE IT! I love a ballsy, take no prisoners heroine, and I love how Evelyn deals with the men she encounters in this male-dominated world of 1912. She's more than a match for 'Thomas' (or should I call him... no, no spoilers), and I can't wait to see how they deal with the Ironclaws now they're a team.

"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish.",TRUE
"If you are a reader who enjoys the challenge of a time sequence that is replete with starts and stops you will enjoy this novel. Set in pre- WWI England, the main character, Ursula, repeatedly dies and then is reborn into a new life.  Everything she did previously is lived again with the exception of the events that led to her death in the previous life, which she has, upon rebirth, mysteriously learned to avoid.  However easy it is, or not, to follow the plot line, the often sporadic insertion of monologue and dialogue that is foreign to the action, makes the text confusing to the point of unnecessary exhaustion.  There is nothing more to recommend the text; by way of attractive characters, interesting events or intriguing action, that might cause the reader to make the effort to decipher it.  From the initial pages you know that Ursula is destined to make an attempt on Adolf Hitler's life.  You might think that tumbling through time and the text would make it worth the trouble.

My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with.

"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.",TRUE
"Not bad for the price.
The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad.",TRUE

"This historical thriller revolves around the Earl of Walden and his family, who all become involved in a life and death struggle the outcome of which could have a serious influence on World War 1.

Walden receives a visit from Churchill, asking for help negotiating with Russia about alliances in the forthcoming War.  Walden feels this is an exciting opportunity to further his career, whilst his Russian wife finds it brings back unwanted memories of a love she has tried to put behind her.  Meanwhile their daughter is busy thinking about being presented to the King and Queen and her first Season  whilst beginning to discover that the real world is not quite as her sheltered upbringing has led her to believe.

Alongside the family activities in London and at their country estate,  the suffragettes are fighting for womens rights, a Russia anarchist has arrived to assassinate the Russian delegate Walden is negotiating with, and interesting discussions are being held on the moving of European boundaries to satisfy political needs.

"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked.

"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that was Allegiant, which was in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book was available for free at my library and the other books I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short stories is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the stories themselves, knowing the truth behind everything as revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I was forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these stories for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the stories were just okay. While we do learn some new details about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which covers a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it was just. okay. Altogether the collection was a three-star read. There was nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library. (Oh, and if you're going to buy it in e-book format, buy them separately. Amazon seems to be taking advantage of the fact that some people may not be observant/bright enough to notice that it's actually more expensive when you buy the bundle than if you just bought them for $1. 99 each.",TRUE

"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price.",TRUE

"First and foremost they claim this is an BBW romance. The author never mentuons that in the book but they do talk about all the time in the gym she spends and how proud she is of her body and her beauty. How he touches her taut abs and toned legs and so on. Yes you can be curvy and fit but I didn't get that from this book. I feel like she is a skinny gym rat. The book itself starts out so boring I  had to force myself to keep reading. It picked up a little at the end but the ""twists"" in the story didn't  intrest me and where kind of sick. Only a handful if males can mate and she was kidnapped after concieving from one night. Then she gets passed around to the brother. They expect her to have sex with him, which she does, and have 20 babies. Then with the upheavals all she is is a vessel. When I read a romance I  do not expect the heroine to have to have sex with different people and be treated like a baby making whore. I am begging anyone reading this review to pass on this book.

"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

Still, I don't regret this purchase at all!",TRUE
"Store bought cakes can be expensive.  We found a recipe to make bird seed cakes and adjusted it a bit so the cakes were not so hard.  We call them Bird-Day Cakes!

Use 1 pack of Knox Gelatin and 2 cups of water and 2 rounded cups of Bird Seed. Prepare Gelatin per directions.  You can use 2 packs if you want the seed cake more firm.  They might even last longer, but I can't imagine the birds like it.  This makes 2 mini bundt ""Bird-Day Cakes"".

Mix together and pour/pack into mini bundt cake molds that have been sprayed with your favorite non-stick spray. (Gotta have the hole in the center for this feeder.) Place in refrigerator until set.

We use Shell-less seeds for this.  They are expensive and you can certainly use regular bird seed or whatever your favorite bird loves.  We only use 1 cake at a time and haven't stacked them yet. The birds finish this off in 2-3 days.

We have giant breeds and one lived to 11 and one is now 10.  We have younger babies also. And it supplies all the energy they need.,TRUE
"Everything about this movie captivated me right from the start.  It's sort of slapstick, but i just loved the portrayal of the characters.  The casting was perfect. The story was interesting, the visuals of the little town were enchanting, filmed in Malta, it carried me away to a fairy tale land and a real mental vacation.  I'm an old lady but I found it irresistible.",TRUE
"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice.",TRUE
"So I read the review and thought I would give it a try.

The first book in the series was the prequel, Prequel 2, and I'm a fan. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I love how the author wrote the descriptions of the characters. I liked the fact that they were all over the place. There was also the fact that the author had to use a lot of language. It was like a well written story.

I liked the fact that the author used a lot of words and it made the story more realistic. I think that the author would have used some of the things that could have been used for a different story.

I liked the fact that the author kept the main character's name and family name. I also liked that the author used a lot of slang.

The story was good. I really enjoyed the story.

"I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

I had a 2TB WD Media Writer and it worked great. I had to start up Win7 64 bit to get the MBR to work. The MBR was all I could get out of Win7 64 bit, but I was able to get it to work on my Win7 64 bit machine. I had to restart Win7 64 bit to get it to work. The MBR is a little bit larger than the Win7 64 bit drive, but I can tell that it works fine on my Win7 64 bit machine.

I have no complaints about this drive.

I don't recommend this drive to anyone unless you have a 32 bit drive, and I don't.

I did have to order another Win7 64 bit drive to get the MBR to work, but it was a pain.I purchased this for my new computer.  I use it for gaming and watching movies.  I don't use it for any other purpose.  I don't use it to use the external hard drive.  The drive is small and works well.  The USB connector is very small and doesn't work as well.

"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain.",TRUE

"This board is perfect for quick games as well as teaching beginners. The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance).

The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.

Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!)

Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc.",TRUE

I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feels their business is in a bit of a rut. I can't say you will find direct examples, but if you keep your mind open you'll see the larger points he is making re: business. It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business, including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.

"I guess the biggest criticism I have of this toy, is really my own fault for not reading the description more thoroughly. I assumed this toy would be perfect for my daughter's bathtime, or to play with in the pool.

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is.",TRUE
"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness.",TRUE

It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

"First off, let me just say we spoil our dog.  I'm sure most people do.  For our little Maltese, we've tried a variety of dental chews.  His favorite treats are Greenies.

After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...

We've tried all kinds.

Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.",TRUE

The faucet is designed for 4"" to 18"" spread between the handle and spout, but I do not recall that being specified in the advertisements. Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance. The LED cable is a three conductor cable with a jack and receptacle connection. To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively.

"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!

He spends the first half of the book in a different college town, but then goes to another college.  He goes to college in a different town and his father is a college professor.

I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.

It is a good way to get a sense of the reality of the situation you are in and how you will react to it.

"I realize that it is not an easy task to make a cold steel bat, but I'm not a fan of the idea. The bat is designed to be a little too cold, so it's not ideal for a bat like this. I wish it was a little thicker, but I don't think it's a bad idea. I'd be more inclined to buy a heavier bat. I just wish there was some kind of ""blinking"" on the bat when I got it, and if I got one I'd be happy. I'm happy with it, but I'm a little concerned about it being too soft. I'll be keeping it at my home to get a better grip on it.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very sharp. I was able to cut down",FALSE
"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light.",TRUE

I had to read the book to get through the story. The author does a great job of describing the characters.

"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.",TRUE

"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form.

However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.

Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten.

Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.

Ghost Whisperer is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a strange and bizarre world where the world is very different from the one they grew up in.

"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.",TRUE

"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.

"In 2006, Grigory Perelman proved that an academic with a PhD in history could make a difference in the lives of two people. The book, ""A History of the United States"", is a great book. It covers the history of the United States from the American Revolution to the present day. In the book, Perelman provides us with a list of the major events that shaped the nation. He discusses the role of the American Revolution and the role of the white slave trade in the growth of the country. He also discusses the history of the American Revolution and the role of the slave trade in the development of American capitalism.

"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects.",TRUE

So we have been drinking wine for the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just ordered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can order one of these at a time for one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner.

"Nobody's Fault was very well written and the author uses descriptions and dialogue with expertise and care. The story itself was told well and the loose ends tied together nicely in the end.

When those kids are grown and gone you can find your own freedom and a new life if that's what you need to. But to walk away from your wife, leave your children to live in a single parent home for your own emotional needs? Selfish beyond description. As for the feelings of his new love, the other woman?

"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

Best regards.",TRUE

"I purchased this product and there was no option in the tools menu to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3.  When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it.  When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

As stated, not HD. And no drivers need for Win 8 or Mac Lion.

Good color, good contrast even in rather low light.
Resolution is way better than an X10 and on a par with older Logitech products.

Mine had a 3.5 MM microphone cable attached with the USB, and nothing comes out, I mean nada. (I don't think they say it does come with audio)

The focus ring lets you go down to about 12"" for a sharp (enough) picture.

The LED lighting as a roller switch in the 5' cable to adjust brightness... IT can (a little) adjust brightness. Sorta, if you play.

No idea what the top button is for. I suspect that maybe with some software it will trigger a snapshot.

"Alright! Finally, my favorite season of Star Trek ever!  I will admit that I thought this one was a little too long and I hated it. The beginning of the season was pretty much just a matter of the movie ending, which was a little long and seemed to be coming from the writers' imagination. I guess it just seemed like a lot of people were so bored with Star Trek. This season seemed to be pretty good. I don't know if I'm going to watch this again, but I will. I love the characters, the story, the special effects, the acting. I really liked the actors, the humor, the dialog. I just wish that they could have given the actors more of a chance to develop their characters. I would recommend this season to anyone.

"Veiled by L. Chapman is a story about losing the one you love and finding someone when you least expect it. Jenny is put through more than one could imagine as she begins to feel her pending nuptials are in danger of panning out. Her fianc, Rich, has become withdrawn in their relationship. Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Much to Jenny's surprise, she finds her husband with another man. He is honest with her and explains the possibility of a health risk. The two are not on speaking terms thanks to this shocking revelation. After tests and full disclosure to Warren, they continue to get closer with their feelings. Knowing her whole world is changing right before her eyes, Jenny decides to move on the best she can and let things take their rightful course.

Veiled ends one happy ending and gives hope to finding a new one. The plot moves quickly as it seems a black cloud is following Jenny everywhere she goes. Her share of bad luck surely must be about to end soon. I was happy to see Mark and Megan were still going strong in their relationship. Baby Lucy is cherished and loved by her little family. Unfortunately, it was hinted that there would be upcoming turmoil with Lucy's custody. This book ends with another cliffhanger and we will have to wait to see exactly what pans out in the series.",TRUE

"First, the outstanding quality of Joanne Harris' writing is her use of mouth-watering culinary descriptions.
Her plot here is much more involved than in Blackberry Wine, and much darker.  I happen to like the darker in terms of reading (my favorite is C.J. Cherryh's Cyteen; check THAT out), but I do have to say the narrator was hard to sit next to for the length of the book.  Witty and earnest and devious as a child; witty and earnest as a sixty-year-old, but much crankier, and though she retains her spirit, she has lost the deviousness which made her younger self a delight.  Case in point:  When a loud neighbor and competitor moves in, her strategies to combat him are downright ordinary, exactly what youth would expect of the rigid elderly.  Her triumph is the sort of thing I can see my grandmother sitting in her living room telling to her elderly friends, while they nod in agreement.  ""And >I< told HIM...""
Some of the reviews seem appalled that the younger Framboise went to such measures to torment her ""poor"" mother.  Poor nothing!  Framboise fought back in what was an intolerable environment.  By the end of the novel one can see her mother does care about her children (though unable to show it) and has her own problems, but one is still hard-pressed not to root for Framboise and her siblings in the situation.
I do have to agree with one reviewer and say kudos to Paul for sticking around the whole time, though I can't see why he does.  Framboise is fortunate he does.
All in all, a great character sketch of the lesser parts of being human.  And the ending made me want to put down the book and go on in denial, making up my own ending and pretending it was the real one -- but that's good, it means it's powerful.  Sad is more powerful than happy.",TRUE

"Wow, this is one very intense read! I was so blown away by the emotional pull in this book. I have read other books that Alice has co-authored with and have always loved her work. I have to say I think she outdid herself on this one. So many times I didn't know if I wanted to laugh, cry or just slam the book down and run. When you meet Saga she is just skimming by. Shes worried about making rent and having food to eat. Doing her best to hold on to a job that is not enough to get ahead. When she is at her lowest point, so she thinks things went south in a hurry. When there is no other option she takes a job as an escort. This is where she comes to know Jackson Stone. He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for. Saga is strong, but like all women she has a breaking point and Jackson seems to find just the right buttons to push to break her when he feels like she is getting too close. These two draw you in and keep you wanting more. Im looking and hoping for more from these two.",TRUE
