I had a lot of fun with this book and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next one.

3.5 Stars

I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This is the second book in the series and I love it! I love the characters and the plot! The two main characters are a perfect combination of fun and sexy. I loved the way the author used the language of romance and the fact that the author did a great job of making it work. The story flowed nicely and kept my interest! I am looking forward to reading more by this author. I hope there is more to come in the series!If you are looking for a little steamy fun, this is for you.

This is a cute story of two people who have been separated in love.

A few things that I liked about the story:

It's short and easy to read.

The characters are well developed.

I liked the story line.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a light read.

I have a problem with the length.

The story is told in one sitting.

The ending is a little long.",FALSE

I have to get the lid off the pot and take the pot to the kitchen for cleaning. It is not very easy to clean.

But it has some issues.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two.",TRUE

"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

"The Ontario Gen II SP-50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel. It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50.

I'd go with the RTAK II all things considered.",TRUE

"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands.",TRUE

"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",TRUE

"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.

It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with.

"The only thing being machine-gunned by the Americans was a lot of soldiers in the field. I had to read a book by the author, ""War Is Not a Good War"" and it was in good shape.

The book is great, but I think the author is putting too much emphasis on the very first part of the book. It is not a great book, but it is worth reading.

"I agree with Vosper's ideas. They are incredibly radical, and yet, at this point in my spiritual journey, they make clear and logical sense. I feel saddened by the vitriol that can result from anyone either agreeing or disagreeing with these ideas. Although I have left theism behind, it has not been without struggle or deep sadness. My former beliefs gave me so much comfort and joy, and a sense of purpose, all of which have now been torn from me. Therefore, I don't condemn or rail against those who still cling to them fiercely. I understand their anger against these ideas - an anger born of fear bordering on panic. And I don't want to be so smugly certain I am right now, as I was so smugly certain I was right when I was a fundamentalist literalist Christian. I have gained much, but may have lost even more.

"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statements of facts introduced into this book are true.  Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.

Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.

Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it.

"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

"I've had them all. Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

"The bar does not fit into the two ends snuggly.  This is I can live with since this is the only bar whose depth fits into the space I have available in my bathroom for a towel bar.  However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now.",TRUE

"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat.",TRUE

"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse. I have no issues with video quality, with the exception of some bumpy Netflix experiences, but that's not a Roku issue.  I have convinced a few of my non-sports viewing friends to get rid of their cable completely and just use Roku.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus are my favorite channels, but I explore the other options every once in a while.

"I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.
It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).
I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.
Little akward to fold.  The front wheels need to be lined up to fit inside the back wheels.  If one forces, I could see where they could be damaged.

"WOWSER

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope. Whichever way she managed to get all those pieces back together, my hat goes off to her as it would have been oh so easy to have departed in other ways.",TRUE

"If you're a parent/grandparent with a youngster just discovering the ""Cars"" movies, I can tell you that my husband and I have had a blast collecting these small, 1:55 scale Mattel models for our grandsons.  You definitely need a strategy if you plan to collect, since their are just SO many of them.  Hard enough trying to just figure out who all of the characters are!

Giuseppi Motorosi is the Italian-speaking pit crew chief for Lightning McQueen's primary rival, Francesco Bernoulli, in the Cars 2 sequel, both of them sporting the colors of the Italian flag, and they were actually sold together in a 2-pack last year (if you're just starting to collect, might want to check the 2-pack out in case it saves you.)  According to the cute little bios they put out on the characters, Giuseppi is designed as a 1966/69 Alpha Romeo Duetto, a former racer himself until he had a major accident at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track on the Curva Parabolica (the final challenge of the race), and has now teamed up with Formula Race champ Francesco.  This - as with all of these little models - is very durable and nicely detailed... just be careful - if you get one of the crew chiefs, your youngster's bound to want them all!

This year Giuseppi is part of the 9-piece WGP Pit Crew collection, along with Alex Machino, Max Schnell's pitty (be careful about adding the racers' little forklift pitty characters too... there's a bunch of them!), Otto Bonn, Austin Littleton, and 2-packs of Manual Maniez/Bruno Motoreau and Jeff Gorvette's Pitty/John Lassetire.",TRUE

Book 2 of the series starts 3 months after the first book ended. Jenna and her five year old daughter are trying to live a normal life away from Lilly's father who happens to be a crime boss of the London mob. Jenna and Lilly barely escaped death at her father's Cornwall property. So Jenna wants to stay away from Farrell Black. However the people who want to kill her are because her father found out a shady lab was developing a bioweapon. Jenna discovers she and Lilly are far from safe and turns to Farrell to help. But Jenna and Farrell realize they must stop this evil group that is willing to kill and threaten. This story becomes extremely exciting as Jenna and Farrell travel from Italy to England to Amsterdam to Germany trying to stay ahead of the murderous group. The book is sit on the edge of your seat exciting but also advances the loving and sensual relationship of ore hero and heroine. The ending makes you want book three immediately but June is the last installment. I highly recommend this series.,TRUE

"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.

"Reading through the different reviews here, you'd think this guy were Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and Wolfgang Mozart rolled into one.  Let me think of the simplest way to say this:  he's not.
The storyline was original, that's for sure.  And his emotion is raw.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of something - although what exactly that is (misdirected youth?  the refusal to accept that people usually _earn_ money?) is sometimes muddled.
But the delivery is poor.  I found it cutesy and contrived.  He relies on the same old gag structure again and again - that one line delivered at the very end to set the last three pages' worth of diatribe on its ear:  ""You just missed your exit"".  ""The wallet was there the whole time.""  and so on.  Add that to the fact that the timeline was impossible to follow, and that the technique of alternating paragraphs between two different time periods does not a gifted writer make, and this presentation had serious flaws.
Unrestrained by literary devices such as plot, he goes on to present a convoluted ""three years [I think it was three years although time flow was truly warped] in the life of"" stream-or-consciousness (whoops I meant ""stream OF consciousness"") story of his recent life.
What's he getting at?  Is he misdirected?  Uninspired?  Lazy?  All of the above?  Am I supposed to admire this?  Is this the role-model of the 21st century?  For the story to be potent, I think it needed a sharper edge.",TRUE

"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other.",TRUE

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.

I found it extremely practical, far more than other books I bought.  It corresponds and doesn't conflict with the manners and socialization classes we are taking for puppy training.  The progression of skills is very logical, allowing you to train using logical building blocks.  Getting the first series of lessons taught to puppy leads you in a logical sequence to the next chapter.  There is also a great chapter on how to resolve problems such as barking, house training, and all the nusiance behaviors (growling, jumping on your bed, etc).

"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power.",TRUE

First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.",TRUE

"Indestructible is a dystopian fantasy that grabs a hold of you, thrusts you into a manic world of action and danger, and doesn't let go. And the moments where you've been given a chance to let your heart slow down don't ever last too long before you're thrown back into the action again.

Leah is a girl who loses everything when an energy blast rips through her town. Now taken in by a band of folks called Pyros, she comes to find out the truth about who she is and what she can do, as well as whom to trust and whom not to.

There is a lot of mythological weaving in this story, which I quite enjoyed. Adams does a nice job of simultaneously answering questions that pop up during Leah's journey and adding new questions as a result of those answers. I found myself wanting to discover exactly what happened in the past to bring this cast of characters to this point.

"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters.",TRUE

"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change.",TRUE

Next I lift and place his back legs, one at a time, into the sack, and after that I gently press on his rump to get him to sit down inside it. Finally I zip him up and lift him up to settle him down into the bag. Putting it in myself is the trickiest part, but I've gotten the hang of it after using it so much. I find it actually pretty comfortable to wear. It helps to cinch the straps and being the bag high up on my back.

For the fit, my boy is a 15 pound miniature poodle, long and lanky for his weight. I measured him according to the manufacturer's instructions, and his length was 17 inches, exactly on the borderline between small and medium. So I got a medium, and while it is roomy it doesn't seem too large. I haven't gotten the booster pad.

In summary, I recommend this sack highly!  It works so well for us and I am so grateful to this company for making such a high quality product.",TRUE

I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.

I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to use bluetooth headphones for listening to music or videos. Great. I like that the cradle is very convenient for holding your tablet when you're doing work. I'm not sure why the design of the cradle has such a long strap, but it's a nice feature. It makes it easier to work around while driving and to keep your tablet upright when you're driving. I've had no problems with this product so far, but I'd be surprised if I never use it.

"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

Mr. & Mrs. no relationships. They have an instant attraction but do not want to be involved with each other because of their friends. They think it will just complicate a already complicated situation with Natasha & Felix, but their chemistry is too strong and situations too intense to break the bond they have. Instead it turns it from friends to lovers. The desire for each other becomes too much and they change their relationship! I absolutely love these two as a couple.

After buying other furniture I was concerned this too would turn out to be built with kittens in mind instead of adult cats, but happily it is perfect for not only kittens, but adults too.  My big 18 lb cat often enjoys resting on top on it as well as inside it and using it to sharpen his claws, even my clawless kitty (I found her that way) enjoys using it to sharpen her non-existent claws.  This was definitely money well spent.  It's well built well and fits large as well as heavy cats, and it's neutral color scheme blends in well with my other furniture.",TRUE
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had to laugh at the antics of the main character, Aiden, to woo Katie over. He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.

Overall I enjoyed this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series to see how the other characters fared.",TRUE

"First of all, you cannot compare ANY books to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it as if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other authors to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either.
With that said, this book tells a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that builds between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read parts of this book and I did get tears in my eyes during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he has for Lisa.
The story begins when Lisa goes back in time, she meets Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story goes on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she knows no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story takes you by suprise. I was not expecting an ending like that, but it was a pleasent ending none the less.
I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys time travel/romance stories. You just CANNOT compare it to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. But Karen Marie Moning does deserve an applaud for this story.",TRUE

"For sports fans, some of the best bits & more from the tv & radio show that is on a bit early if you're unemployed. Mike Greenberg takes charge most of the time. Mike Golic is now well into his second career as co-anchor of the show. He was a defensive lineman in the NFL for nine years. He seems chronically grumpy mainly because he has to to put up with ""nancy boy"" Mike Greenberg. For his next career Greenie wants to be baseball commissioner. He has some new rules for the game that make sense: more day games & bring back double headers which would in turn shorten the season so they wouldn't have to play outside in November in Minneapolis or New York or  Boston. Some make no sense. No soup will be served in any ball park. Bring back the troughs in the men's rooms, like in Wrigley field. Ah, tradition. They talk about the unwritten rules of baseball. They are moronic, numerous & as old as the game. I love them & woe be to the player that breaks them. Other sports are covered too. The ""sheets of integrity"" for ""March Madness"" college basketball is classic. Golic has no integrity when it comes picking his 64 teams. They have an annual wager that is a highlight & has included in the past Greenie milking a cow on live & Golic getting his rather hairy body waxed.

One day, after running a memory test for 8 hours, the server refused to boot.  After letting it sit for 8 hours, it booted just fine.  I immediately suspected a heat issue.

I purchased these coolers because they were active air movers versus just passive metal coolers. (and the price was right)

They've worked perfectly.  My server has not crashed once since I installed them!!  It runs much faster, and I've not noticed an increase in noise.

Prior to installing them, the chips were extremely hot to the touch after a memory test.  Today with the Air Coolers, they barely luke warm.

"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.

"The design of this faucet is Transitional bordering on Contemporary. The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.  The pull down is very easy to use and works better than having a separate sprayer.  The faucet is easy to clean and keep cleaned as well.  The installation was very easy and the instructions were good but not great.  I have installed a few faucets so I had a working understanding of what I was doing.  Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.  Once the old faucet was removed the total installation time was less than a 1/2 hour.  The handle can be installed to the left or the right based on your desire.

"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected.  Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.

"I purchased 2 bras....this one and the Bali Women's Smooth U Front Close Bra.  I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.

"I searched all the blogs but NO ONE could tell me how to hang this type of derailleur on a cheap bike...

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is..

"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

"Ryder is still grieving the wife he loved and lost more than 4 years ago, but finds himself drawn to his best friend Tess in deeper ways; they are in love with each other, but don't want to risk ruining their friendship.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary.

"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar.

Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag.

I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.,TRUE

"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:

"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product.

"This rug is awesome. It is so comfortable and the quality is great. It was delivered on a stormy day and survived transport. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen.",TRUE

"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",TRUE

First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately.

"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless.",TRUE

"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is.",TRUE

It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.

Daryl is a polar bear shifter in the Tennessee Honey band. He is older then the reat and has felt alone for sometime. While taking a dip, he meets Matt who happens to see him in his polar bear form. Matt's dad is a grizzly shifter and not the best person (even though Matt has been sheltered from this information). When Daryl meets Matt's mom Alison, there is a connection between them two of them. Alison doesn't want to act on it due to her ex and believes Mat should come first. Matt is getting to the age of shifting, so Alison ask Daryl to talk with Matt. During this time, everyone becomes closer including Daryl and Alison.

Can Alison over come her fears of losing Matt? Is Daryl willing to take a chance and stay with them?

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",TRUE

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",TRUE

Communication is a lot needed to understand each other, too, it is a give and take relationship. We should learn to listen and connect with them and even become a child if needed, that way we will be able to understand them. Be fun and creative! I highly recommend this book!",TRUE
"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft.",TRUE

Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the flashing rings, the seller or with amazon, except for as a customer.",TRUE

It definitely was trying to show that we are many different people, and we show different ""faces"" depending on who we are dealing with throughout our lives.

I didn't might the drums so much but the creepy sexual undertones in an Ingmar Bergman style along with the 40's esc dramatic - and I might add ""irritating"" music. The switching to creepy black, and white; as well as the image of spiders also reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's style of cinematography. The scenes in which the characters didn't ""turn the damn lights on"" kind of bugged me. Again, the Director may have intentionally done this to show that sometimes we ourselves are not even aware of these different layers within our personality's.

"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from.

"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared.

"Got this as our older router/wireless AP was having difficulty with having XP and Win7 machines connected at the same time. This one has been great for all devices, solid signal strength about 30 feet beyond the perimeter of the house (brick). Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue. But sometimes it is just the router (have tested directly from the modem) and both wireless and wired connections all fail. Haven't tried a firmware update yet as honestly... we have just gotten used to having to power cycle it occasionally and it is a pretty quick fix.",TRUE

This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner.",TRUE

"I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.

I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed. I was able to put it together by myself in about 45 minutes.

"Warning- some spoilers inside:
Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better.
Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry.
And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing.
The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.
I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three.",TRUE

"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.

"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned.",TRUE

The story of how 300 years old people are reanimated after being exposed to the sun and the other elements.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is based on a novel by the late Robert Burns.  The film was filmed in the 1980s and is a 2 hour documentary on the history of the universe.  The DVD features interviews with the film making crew and the crew members.  The movie is a continuation of the original film by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is about the creation of the universe.  This is the first time I have seen this film.  It is definitely a must see for fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.This was a great movie and the acting was good. I loved it and the story was good,FALSE
"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time.",TRUE

"I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.",TRUE

"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.",TRUE

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",TRUE

"Shortly after starting to use this product I developed my first ever case of Pink Eye. The doctor verified that it was not a viral or bacterial infection.

"The construction of this Mag-Lite Solitaire is really quite good.  It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.",TRUE

"Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection.

"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product.

"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build.",TRUE
"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",TRUE

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them. This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget. This is a great book.",FALSE

I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it.",TRUE

"REVIEW REFERENCES the ""Wireless"" Unit:

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

In this story there are quite a few dark moments that have you holding your breath and praying and hoping for the best. What I loved about this story is that it provides you with the past and present time so you can fully understand what happened in Teagans life that got her to that moment. You start to understand Teagan more, or at least I did.

I thought this story was very well done. I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was.

This model is different than the Wembley model. On the Wembley model only the thin bar rotates up and you can easily slide the rolls on and off--but I found that the bar rattles a bit . On this model the end of the bar that pivots is attached to about an inch wide segment of  the support bracket.

"Best value non smart tv on amazon. This review is of the 39 inch model. I did a lot of research and at the time this was by far the highest quality and best value at this price point and size. It's not a smart tv but most smart tv's apps are hard to use and poorly implemented besides I have an xbox and chromecast so I don't care about it being a dum TV.

Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it. A quick google search will yield settings that work well but I had to fiddle with the backlighting and black levels to get it how I thought looked best.

Sound: other reviews say sound sucks on this tv. The sound is actually quite good as long as it's not mounted to the wall. When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra ""BASS""

"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying.",TRUE

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years.

It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer.

"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR. All in all, this comes across as a cheap, uninspired knock-off of other fantasy classics and is not worth wasting one's money on. I would recommend passing on this one.",TRUE

"Anyone familiar with the Desire, Oklahoma series will recognize the cast of characters in this story -- including Dillon and Ryder. The newest addition to the town comes in the form of Alison (Ally as affectionately referred to by Ryder). Alison comes to Desire on the heels of a bad breakup from an abusive boyfriend. Similar to all the other stories in the series, Dillon and Ryder come swooping into her life completing ensconcing themselves in it while overwhelming her with their (neanderthalithic) overbearing ways and masculinity.

The story prattled along at a lumbering pace, IMHO, as Alison whined about things being ""none of your (Dillion and Ryder's) business"" (said 14 times) and spanking threats from the men (mentioned 33 times...yes...I counted). The story was highly repetitive...not only of itself but of the other stories in the series. Really the characters in these stories are interchangeable because the story lines are so consistent with one other. This series now has 8 books in it...and honestly, as a reader, I'm getting to the point where I don't care because there is nothing unique about them anymore. Desire for Three: Winning Back Jesse is actually about the characters in Desire for Three. *Scratches my head*....so now we're going back and revisiting characters? Pass!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Leah Brooke's work, I just want to see some originality come into play in her stories. As they are now...they are just meh because of near exactness of the stories and characters -- resistant females...dominant men...and they all live happily ever after.

Send a couple looking to add to their triad.......give me something different to work with.

Bradley's characters are likeable and fully human and his prose is rich. The scene toward the end of the book where the paintings are found reminded me of the scene in A.S.

"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.",TRUE

"*I was given a copy of this book as a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!",TRUE

"This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.",TRUE

"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge.",TRUE

"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

I read directions in manual just because wise thing to do. I opened the fly nut 6 or 7 times and ran it until air was out of hydraulic line. After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading reviews about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentlemen on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant  wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hours splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chips to stick to it. And it helps to prevent screeching sounds.

"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.",TRUE

"For the price, these treat boxes are excellent.  The 6"" tall measurement is from the base to the top of the handles when they are assembled.  In terms of storage space, the interior dimensions once assembled can accommodate items about 6"" long, 3"" wide, and 3-4"" tall.  Like most cheap mass-produced paper goods, there are some small defects on some individual pieces (some cuts aren't clean, some stick together, etc.),  If you are a perfectionist who will be bothered by these slight defects, you should consider ordering a 10% overrun.  Mine were going to kids, so I didn't care.  I would not use these for heavy items, but they were great for kids party favors.",TRUE
"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.",TRUE

While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect.

"(Wife): Basic Paw Patroller. You must attach stickers yourself. There are also 1-2 other things you must attach / get in place before letting a kid play with this one. So, I unpackaged the thing and prepped it before giving it to our daughter for Christmas. Comes with Ryder figure and ATV. The ATV is pretty sturdy and good on carpet. But, Ryder's legs are rather fragile. The Patroller trailer section only holds THREE (3) medium-sized vehicles while closed. BUT, you CAN stuff an entire set of Paw Patrol figurines inside the Paw Patroller when closed IF you use figurines, racers and/or an appropriate combination of figurines and mid-sized vehicles. The cab of the truck holds 4-5 figurines. (Five if you really pack 'em in, possibly plus 1-2 removable packs. )

Here's what we stuff in our Patroller (while still being able to close it):

Two medium-sized vehicles with riding figures (Ryder & ATV, and Everest & snowmobile);
Two small racers (Chase and Zuma);
Two figurines plus their detachable packs (Skye and Rocky);
Two figurines with spring-action packs (Robodog and Tracker); and
Two figurines with other features (Rubble and Marshall). Reasonably sturdy Paw Patroller. Makes noise. Comes with battery. Rather large. Opens to reveal a second floor. Not bad for transporting or storing all Paw Patrol figures / vehicles IF you plan ahead. Our daughter enjoyed it for Christmas.",TRUE

"This CPU was too fast.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not.",TRUE

"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",TRUE

"Intensity is very special book, since its story is so different than any other and so damn unpredictable!

Every twist and every turn the story takes is unexpected and brilliantly developed. The characters take us in one spectacular ride and we love every second of it!

I couldn't put it down!!

Serena is such a lovely character! She has a good heart, but she isn't naive or crying her heart out over men. She is a good and loyal friend. She isn't fearless; she has fears that she deal with every single day. She is a good girl, but isn't judgemental regarding others who arent.

Linc is well..a good man / alpha male. He has this Youre mine - No one touches you thing, but he isn't overbearing. He protects with elegance, should I say. Hes quite the gentleman for an alpha male, too.

I have to say that everyone should have one Serena as a friend and definitely a Linc as a man!

Its beautifully written and everything fits perfectly!!

Intensity is a great book and I loved it!

I strongly recommend it!!

However, I would like to say that its the FIRST BOOK!! The story continues to the next book or books.

Personally, I strongly dislike when I don't know this fact before I read the book. I don't have an issue if its a 2 book story or a trilogy. But I do want to know beforehand. Unfortunately, it does not happen.

In conclusion, Intensity is a great book that you MUST READ!!

So, Intensity receives 5 Huge Sparkling Golden Stars!!",TRUE

"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.",TRUE

"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!

Get this set and let Bette Davis show what great acting is.",TRUE

He assembles 11 men to help him and they are played by such crowd-pleasers as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, and Elliott Gould.  The movie is fun, slick and full of high-tech and low-tech gimmicks which help Ocean's 11 gain access to the casinos.  My biggest complaint is that Julia Roberts is miscast and underutilized as the trophy wife/girlfriend of the two adversaries.  However, if you can put that aside, Ocean's 11 offers an enjoyable evening of entertainment.",TRUE

The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.

"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or

"Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.

"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

"Funny, I just sold a Bulova Precisionist chronograph (9B175) this past week, and then ended up getting this one!  The other Bulova was a bit too large, heavy, and chunky for my tastes.  This one, however, is very nicely done!!

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

All in all, this is a fine watch for $200+ dollars!!  I'm happy to add it to my collection.",TRUE

"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others.",TRUE

"This movie is wonderfully simple and sincere in presenting its message. The story is based on the life of Patrick ""Tyler"" Doherty. It presents the question ""Why God?"" Here is an upright church-going family, where firstly the father and main bread winner dies unexpectedly, and then the younger of two brothers is diagnosed with a rare breed of brain cancer, that is quite aggressive.

Most Christians believe in divine healing, but what is the response supposed to be when a much needed healing does not take place in the life of a young innocent boy? This is the scenario that is presented. Each member of the family suffers from the pressure of this situation and Tyler's grandmother steps in as a source of help and encouragement.

Tyler keeps his faith and starts writing his letters to God in order to keep his perspective of things and those around him. In an apparent answer to one of these letters, a new postman shows up and befriends the family. He has his own family challenges, but Tyler's resolve and determination motivates him not up give up on trying to solve his own personal problems.

This film is very moving emotionally, it will make most people cry and will keep you hoping and believing. The message rings true to the end, hold on to Jesus no matter the outcome.",TRUE

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written.

"""Ape House"" is a light read that attempts to open the animal world to us by bringing the Bonobos Apes to life in an original way.

This is a story about a family of Bonobos, their caretaker scientist Isabel Duncan and a down to earth reporter John Thigpen. I will cover the plotting in a few words, it begins with the primate language laboratory being bombed and Isabel left badly injured, severe enough to end up in the trauma ward of the closest hospital. The Bonobos fall into the hands of a porn producer and are locked up in a house with cameras broadcasting their every move on cable television. Reporter John Thigpen covers the story while his personal life is on a down turn, his home life it is about to take a drastic change. The plotting gets meatier when Isabel is released from hospital and teams up with John to find out who targeted the laboratory, for what reason and what has happened to her family of apes.

The story explores in a far-fetched semi captivating manner, the issue of animal rights from the point of view of activists, scientists and the public. The plot takes a meandering course with a bit of action here and there mostly done by the humans, there are also subtle references to sexual activities amongst the apes and their unique methods of communication. I found this part satire and part morality driven tale was presented to us by a cast of lackluster and easily forgotten characters, maybe if the Bonobos had been given a greater role it would have left a more lasting impression. Unfortunately the book started strong just to peter out by the end, I was disappointed when the tale did not capture the apes' behaviour, gestures and emotions in a more detailed fashion.

Although the story was not what I had anticipated, I nevertheless enjoyed the change.",TRUE

This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.,TRUE

"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character.",TRUE
"First: I don't like to give anything away about the stories.

The Bombay's are a family of assassins and have been for the past 4000 yrs or so. If you are a blood relative, then you will become an assassin or die. If you marry into the family, male or female, you must change your last name to Bombay.  The children are all named after countries, states, cities, etc. The cousins that we read about are fun and funny.  Despite being assassins, they live normal lives, just like the rest of us, except for the rather large trust funds that each has.  The assassin business has paid well over the years.  They find themselves in precarious situations, and the fun begins. Despite the sometimes poor editing, I enjoy these books a lot. I tend to pick them up and read the next when I need a good laugh.",TRUE
"At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned.",TRUE

"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then picks a question card from the pile and reads it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All players start with 10 points each and would bet 1-3 points based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the questions are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidates and how the players would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidates and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on.

Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the questions presented tend to be adult only (sex related). As such, I'm seriously doubt that the age 14 and up rating from the manufacturer is appropriate. I would personally remove those questions before passing it to my teenager when he has his friends over. The game comes with everything you'll need such as a dry erase board and pen for writing the five candidates down, 1-2 point chips for betting and spinners for selecting your own vote.",TRUE

"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read that kept me interested. I couldn't help feeling for what Paige went through as a kid and how it shaped her life and her families. It truly shows how when one person in a family is ill, it affects everyone.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Of course at times I wasn't always a fan of Jake's attitude, but as the book progressed he got better. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this enjoyable series.

"Similar issue to another recent reviewer.  The screen I received did not have LP133WF2 anywhere on it, except for a printed sticker on the cardboard packing.  Instead, the labels on the screen itself said N133HSE-EA3.  The port on this particular screen is on the opposite side from the cable and the OEM screen.  The cable is too short to reach to the opposite side, and after removing the bottom cover, I discovered you can't even move the cable to the other side as the port on the motherboard is on the same side as the OEM screen.

"The best part of this scene is the cannon that swivels on the turret and the Tauntaun.  Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for $40+ the other portions of the scene.  A pretty good value.  On it's own this scene can clearly shows a solid Hoth scene-but is by no means huge.

As part of a larger Hoth scene, this becomes essential.  I have added it to the Limited Edition Echo Base 7879, Hoth Wampa Cave 8089, Hoth Rebel Base 7666 one additional Echo Base, two Motorized At-At's (10178), other dark gray and white misc pieces AND white dog toy stuffing for quite the display.

Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down.

"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.",TRUE

"These sorts novels rest a lot on believable characters. The problem with Florida novels is that real living characters in Florida often eclipse any fictional characters for stupidity, corruption and evil intent. This is the state that attracts serial killers, Koran burning ministers, scammers and con artists, and whose main reputation in other states for monumental zaniness. Here Randy Wayne White has created a sane grounded, and admirable character. Most importantly he doesn't make her a superwomen, kung fu warrior. She's brave and tough and smart, but she makes mistakes in a dangerous situation that are both human and suspenseful. The sort that anyone placed in a highly stressful situation would make. My complaint about a lot of writers in this genre is their characters are too masterful and unbelievable and you can lose interest in them easily. The second part that I liked about this is its a tightly plotted ""little"" story that deals with evil and takes us on a little journey through west florida and the thousand islands. And that too makes it very readable. The challenge for Randy White is that of a male trying to write in the first person about a female. I think it's extremely difficult to do. And I think the author does a good job of this. But not quite. Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It could be that as a fan I could not forget the male Doc of his other novels, and I had the odd sensation of the marine biologist sort of springing out in drag sometimes. I'm pretty much convinced though that this is more my fault than the authors. If you are a fan read this one. It's even better if you are new to his fiction. It's great, and a new start, for White. I think Hanna, as a fishing guide, and cracker descendent, will be able to go places that the good Doctor can't quite find.",TRUE

"I could sense the author's presence in this book of short stories; I almost felt as if she were reading them to me. I believe she is highly invested in her characters.

The stories, as indicated by the book's title, are grim, dealing with issues such as mortality, helplessness, identity and revenge. The story that resonated with me the most was The Promise, which partnered innocence with malignant intent. The resolution is tragic.

The stories are arranged in segments: Short, Shorter and Shortest. For me, the Shortest stories are presented more as ideas than as full tales, and need more content. However, the ideas are solid. I think that with a little time and polish, Alisha ""Priti"" Kirpalani will be a name to watch in the future.",TRUE

"I thought that this would be more of a baseball book, as I'm a big fan of the nation's pastime. However, Babe Ruth figures into the story only tangentially as a means of helping to set the stage--Boston, as WWI is drawing to a close, and Prohibition is on its way. This book is a nice blend of fact and fiction, and the facts are more engrossing than the fiction. Boston at that time was a city in trouble, anxious to blame just about everything on the Communists, except perhaps the flu epidemic, and by the end I felt as if that had happened a couple of books ago. The family histrionics are fairly predictable, with the bad son (Connor), the good son (Danny, our hero), and the young son (Joe). Of course, Mom and Dad have their heads in the sand and think that the good son is really the bad son and vice versa. There's also Eddie, who came over on the boat from Ireland with Dad and is evil personified. Dad and Eddie are cops on the take, and Danny, also a cop, gets involved with unionizing the police force.

"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.

It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.

In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death.",TRUE
"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.",TRUE

The nearly 2-year-old loves to fiddle with the bricks and build her own little structures for the bunnies to sit on. The set is a great balance of building blocks, plus the ""extras"" of a fence piece, carrots, bowl and flowers.

We unfortunately lost the brown bunny a couple weeks ago, and never found it. After looking around on ebay, I finally used the Lego website to ask for a replacement part. Their customer service was excellent--I was on hold less than a minute and they were very proactive in helping me out.

Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray.

Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )

"Using his unique style, Vonnegut tells the galaxy about our dying planet.  He sees it as a hideous mess of robotic creatures programmed to destroy themselves, specifically through destruction by American capitalism and racism.  At times this does seem a bit cliche, but his style is anything but.  It's funny, original, and at times very personal.

The best parts of the book are when he literally draws himself into the story.  He tries to be a good God to his characters, but seems to fail as our Creator must have.  It's not as good as Slaughter House Five, but his shocking style is in strong form.

For those who want to pick up the audio version for the Vonnegut interview- don't.  In the beginning of the interview Vonnegut and his interviewer both reveal that they haven't read the book in a while, then proceed to talk about completely unrelated topics which go nowhere.

"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far.",TRUE

"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.

"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!",TRUE

"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Confidence is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that has also hopped to the top of the to buy list for me.",TRUE
"If you are interested in learning what happens at sea when boredom, monotony, ennui  and endless accounts of filler material taken from every one of the good, action packed adventures that began this series then this is the book for you. I happen to like learning what a day may have looked like at sea in that era but not to the extent that it is all that we learn about over all the pages except the last thirty when the action begins but is broken with an abrupt ending. Of course the action resumes where it left off at the beginning of the next book. In what is rapidly becoming a dissatisfying series, this is the supreme example of dissatisfaction up to this point in my opinion. As usual, I cant fault the writing but the point of this story seems to have been to sell one more book no matter the consequences of not providing an entertaining story. When I first read this series I thought every one of them was a masterpiece of naval historical work. Now that Ive been hooked by the genre, I can say many more recent writers have exceeded these last few books in story telling quality. Two that immediately come to mind are Dewey Lambdin and Jay Worrell. From the same timeframe when OBrian was writing, I value Dudley Popes work more highly. Considering my lack of memory of what the rest of the series holds I hope my opinion of these last few books is dispelled by those remaining. Like the last book, you could completely skip this one without losing anything in the overall storyline.",TRUE

"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.

Suction appears good and it picked up everything we threw at it, including pet hair, sand, dirt and dust just fine.  This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air for us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.

You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills.",TRUE

"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people.",TRUE

"I picked the ""Small"" size. For the review I chose ""Fits as expected"" but that's not EXACTLY true. The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable. Has ties to make it a bit smaller, a nice little hood that doesn't fall over my eyes, the fleece is super soft and comfortable and made me noticeable warmer in a cool room. Has on inside pocket on your left side. Very solid product especially for the price.",TRUE

"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one.

"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.",TRUE

As far as sizing goes, this runs pretty on track, i ordered this in a size 6t for my 3 year old who typically wears size 5t/6t and it fits her pretty nicely, she is about 43lbs and 42inches! The straps on this are simple and crisscross in the back, they are also resizable. This is a unique and fun suit, definitely cuter then any suit I've purchased in stores. The little hat that came with this is made out of the same materials as the suit, it is kind of small for my daugh though. Overall I'm really happy with this!!!!

"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either.",TRUE

"To call this movie Prisoner of Azkaban is a disgrace is to make it a glorified, self-serving, and often boring movie.

"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.
What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor.
The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts.
Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them.",TRUE

"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol.",TRUE

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want.

"I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.

"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable.",TRUE

"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender.",TRUE

I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

Highly recommended; an inexpensive solution to potentially expensive home-maintenance problems.",TRUE

"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

"I kept feeling like this man must have been to these places where warlords rule. The warlords, the economy, child soldiers all of it was brought to life, but in the context of upper-class America. The book is dark, but it's not actually dark enough to fully bring it to life. However, I think that's a good thing, because the reality is so horrific that it would damage his relationship to his readers. It's enough. I say this as someone who has published for West Point on the subject of warlords. Paolo has the dynamics of the soldier boys down. I kept wondering, ""Did this guy live it?"" which is about as good a compliment as one can give an author.

His creatures are very good. There are coywolves, also called red wolves. That bounced me out of the story a bit, but then I realized that he connected me into the world that way. The genetically engineered creature named Tool was interesting. I found myself wondering how to make him, and realizing that he could be made, one at a time as a chimera, through surgery in utero. Which was a bit of a brrr, moment. The conditioning though, that would be harder.

It's good sci-fi, but it's more than just a story. It gives an opportunity for Americans to feel what it's like to be caught up in such madness. The madness exists today - even now.

The one thing I would have liked though, is for the Drowned Cities to run piracy operations like is done off the coast of Somalia. (It won't surprise me if Libya starts doing it too, but inside the Mediterranean it can't be ignored as much as Somali.) That's a tiny miss to his economy of the cities.

By the way, the Zulus - on theory about this tribe is that they descended from a lost Roman garrison on the southern end of the empire after Rome disintegrated. The garrison became a tribe with roots in military traditions, much like the depiction of the warlord armies of the Drowned Cities.",TRUE

"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use for hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds more, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is important to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal for one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star herefor the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room for spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into more parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.

"This season is hard to stomach.  The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch.

You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her!

"My daughter liked the included doll and pet (note its only 1 pet, not 3 like the Amazon description says). She didn't like the house itself much and i cant blame her. Its a cute little house but one that is badly made.

You pretty much need to assemble everything which is a pain. I'd say it would be a good exercise for a kid but my 12 year old couldn't assemble it on her own. I probably spent 45min assembling it. Alot of the pieces didn't properly snap on and i have no doubt it will pop off with continual play. The door is horrendous, it easily open ands doesnt stay closed. The background of the house inside is just a cardboard you slot in. The finished product is a good size; not too big or too small.

They included like 50 small stickers and my daughter loves stickers though so she did have alot of fun sticking them on the house and customizing it. She is also having alot of fun with the mobile app. But in the end, i wouldnt recommend this. If you kid really wants a LPS toy i would pass on this.",TRUE

"I can honestly say I am famous for my mashed potatoes within my family and my husband's family. Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef!

"Let me begin by saying my husband and I got married on a really tight budget.  So we've had to think outside the box to have what wealthier folks might take for granted.  One of those areas revolved around our wedding bands.

Originally we had purchased tungsten rings. Wow. Bad move.  Apparently with tungsten you'll lose your finger before you lose your ring.  You can't cut those things off.  And being that my husband works in a very hands on field, I didn't like the idea of him having to lose his finger just because his ring wouldn't come off.

So we have these silicon ones a try. And I must say that I'm in love.  They are SOOO flexible and stylish! They are easy to do work with and I don't worry about losing a stone or anything.  They not only serve the purpose of a ring, but they also take ring wearing on a non-traditional route that I especially appreciate.  And they come in three different colors and these really nice felt bags for storage!  They are super cool! And they are priced so affordably.

But I think the biggest selling factor for me was the customer service.  We were contacted by, who I believe was the owner to make sure we were satisfied with our product.  Wow! For a ring priced for the average person, that was definitely above average service.  That sold it for me.

I highly recommend this ring to anyone who wants to get a nice symbol of your union but on a budget.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase and hope you will be as well.

"If you're willing to watch a movie about time travel, you're already watching a movie with an impossible plot device, so all other twists should be taken in context.  It is a typical cause-effect-cause inversion loop, raised a few levels and loops.  There are no branching timelines or alternate realities.  There is no ""time paradox,"" unless you count its inception, which I still haven't figured out solidly.  Its well-acted and skillfully laid out so that many of the bigger, more radical plot jumps are easier to buy into.  There's a central gender twist that many of the negative reviews are hung up on ... but those reviews don't even cite the correct gender issue, as if it were a modern psychological political progressivist political gender issue, even tho' this gender issue is physical was dealt with exactly as it would have been back then (and often today). Still, it's a contrivance that's essential to the plot, but revealed carefully and orderly so you can focus on the characters and how things play out (unless you're hyper-sensitive about normalcy).  If you're attentive, as you figure out the first few twists, you'll find the later twists easy to predict.  But I still haven't figured out two points: 1. The prime mover of the cycle of events  2. the motive for the agency causing what they cause  3. how the agency first caused what they cause.  (Okay, that's three, but they overlap.)

"I am a long time Skechers shoe wearer for two reasons: 1. I have worn them for fifteen years and 2. I need a wide shoe, which Skechers has always had, which is why I have worn them for fifteen years.

The pilot is one of my go-to boots. I wear the hell out of them and buy a new pair every other year depending on what I put them through. I wear them for dress, for work, for hiking, for fishing. They hold up very well, always look good, and are always comfortable.

The biggest reason I wear them is that I can trust the size. I wear a 13 EE and over the years the fit has always been true. That's a huge relief since buying a good, wide, boot or show is a serious PITA.

The boots are not without their short comings but these are, relative to the price, minor things. The shoe-lace metalic tabs get lose eventually and bend and require a pair of pliers to bend back and keep in place. But, like I said, this is a minor thing.

"I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.",TRUE

"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?

Also, I noticed Learning Resources commented on another review recently, stating that the only updates they made to the board were artistic. That is patently false and is the difference between a one and five star game/review for me.",TRUE

"I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

NOAH'S COMPASS features Liam Pennywell.  In the opening pages, we learn that he has lost his job as a teacher and that he is moving from his apartment into a smaller one to economize.  We discover a few other bits and pieces as well:  he has been married twice (he is divorced from his second wife), and he has three grown daughters plus an older sister.  And then, after an exhausting day of moving and having settled gratefully into bed, Liam wakes up the next day in a hospital, with no memory of how he got there.

This is certainly an interesting premise for a novel.  Liam has not forgotten who HE is; rather, he simply has selective amnesia for the events surrounding the break-in to his home (for he is told that is what happened) and everything immediately thereafter.  Initially, he becomes obsessed with getting these memories back, which leads him on sort of a quest, bringing a new woman unexpectedly into his life, Eunice.  But from here, the book becomes much more haphazard, taking many seemingly random twists and turns--e.g., we learn more about Liam's past, there is some development in the relationship with his daughters, etc.

Ultimately, however, there seems to be no true purpose to this story.  Although I found Liam likable and was actually rooting for him, there just wasn't much to root for by the end of the novel.  So, while the reading of this book was mostly enjoyable, the lack of a satisfying conclusion was disappointing, and with that, I give it a final rating of 3 1/2 stars.",TRUE

I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.

Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a character who will say what they feel, and I have been told on many occasions that I need a filter....so I feel as if me and Leslie are one in the same. Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.

That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!

However, once the seeds of awareness are planted, Amy discovers that her attachment to Matt gradually begins to change. When Matts vengeful brother starts trouble, Amy is forced to hide the budding relationship because Matt insists on protecting her reputation.

"Always looking for something new to read.  When I read the description on this and realized there were additional books by the author Parnell Hall, thought I would read The Baxter Trust to check out the writer's story line.

Sheila Benton; has a trust account that says if she embarasses the family name she will loose her money.  The story opens with Sheila and her boyfriend (who by the way is married) doing drugs.  He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.

The dress does not look like much when taken out of the plastic bag - the Navy Blue seems somewhat dull, and the fabric is soft cotton jersey, somewhat thin.
But boy, does it transform when put on! The pattern is really flattering and is really smart - though made in China, it is made for larger-boned European women and is very flattering. Here's what worked on my 5.4, 165-lb, slightly pregnant (and suddenly size 12 instead of 8) frame:
- Shoulders fit just right - nothing cuts into armpits, nothing falls off - sleeves start where they are supposed to start
- Sleeves themselves are of decent length - not too short, they run to mid-palm and can be pulled up slightly
- Neck line is beautiful - it drapes nicely on the chest, and would work for small or big-busted
- Length is great - hits right below the knee (and will probably hike up just a bit as belly grows)
- Ruched pattern in the front and in the back creates slim silhouette and has plenty of fabric to expand as pregnancy progresses
- Unless it fades or shrinks in laundry, I see myself wearing this dress when not pregnant - it would look nice on a curvy figure.

"I was a tiny tot--like one of Don Draper's kids, at the time of the events depicted in this season, and this series makes me feel I can make windows into my parents' world, even into their souls.

Dick Whitman's transformation into Don Draper is a brilliant trope, which operates both on the level of metaphor and plot, & is key to characterization.

Even if Dick Whitman had never switched dog tags with his dead commanding officer in Korea, he would have done everything possible to reinvent himself--and obliterate his past.  His ambition drives him into a brave new world in which he, rather like a master spy, must be the bravest.  The new name and social security number make this much more real & palpable, while generating practical complications which fuel the plot and allow us tantalizingly brief glimpses of the bleak world which drove him to his desperate deception.

Poignantly, he hands his half brother $5,000, a large sum in the early 1960's, to, as Dick/Don puts it, ""make a new life for yourself,"" to be another ""Don Draper,"" and vanish from Don's world.  But his brother misses the mark.  For mysterious reasons, he hangs himself.  In doing so, the half-brother's feeble surrender to fate becomes not only a foil for Don's strength, and the boldness of his social/psychological imagination, but an index of the ruthlessness with which he is prepared to ""murder his past.""

Looking at this series from the outside, the sets, costumes, automobiles, & etc., are every bit as authentic as other celebrated period dramas like Downton Abbey.  And in the the social realm, the casual racism, sexism, and class consciousness is perfect down to every dowdy pleat in Peggy Olson's skirt, every limp lock of hair in her bangs, every note of assumed superiority in Peter Campbell's prep school accent.

It's all here, a gripping sixties soap opera that will startle you, amaze you, melt your heart--and freeze it, keep you guessing--and hooked!",TRUE
"So-so.  That's how'd I'd describe this romance collection.

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.

The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

"I recently purchased the ""ultra"" model on Amazon along with the forever litter tray and crystals.  I haven't used the Forever litter tray yet (the Scoopfree Ultra came with one tray/crystals so I'm using that first.)  The scoopfree ultra machine seems very sturdy and I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far.  I really like the counter that keeps track of how many times the machine is used, at first I thought it was an unnecessary feature, but it really helps to know the cats are actually using it and when to replace the cartridge.  I have two cats and at first they saw the machine and were scared of it.  I mixed in some of their old litter and took away the old litter box completely and I'm happy to report they are both using it!  I'm keeping the hood off for now, I'm concerned that they feel too intimidated if they are enclosed inside the box, I will put it back on in the future when they are more comfortable with the new machine.  When my item was delivered, it was not sent in a shipping box with padding, only in the manufacture's box with a label slapped on.  Needless to say the box was beaten and looked taped together when it arrived.  In hindsight, I probably would recommend buying the box at a local pet store instead of online, luckily I've never had to return anything to amazon, but it seems like it would be a big hassle if the unit arrived broken or the cats decided not to use it.

Box works just as I had expected, no complaints (although it is kind of loud, but what do you expect?!)  I'm very satisfied with this product.",TRUE

An Inescapable Attraction is an engaging western romance that is set in the time period following the Civil War, but before the turn of the century.

"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again.

"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money.",TRUE

It was just awful for her. In the morning, of course, we rushed her to the vet. That was Saturday morning and now it's the wee hours of Monday (I can't sleep) and she's still at the animal hospital having IV fluids, anti-emetics and antibiotics. The vet hopes she can come home later today, but it might not be until tomorrow. The ONLY thing my dogs ate that was new and different in the last several days were these T-Bonz. They each got 2 as a treat. I didn't think the treats had anything to do with it until my other dog had diarrhea and threw-up a bit that morning before we went to the vet. Thankfully he only vomited once and only had a bit of diarrhea and soft stools a couple of times. My pup that got sick had a splenectomy last year, so I'm thinking that whatever was in these treats that made them sick, her body just had a much harder time fighting it off than his. I strongly recommend you NOT give your dog these treats unless you're willing to risk a hefty vet bill, a very sick and completely miserable dog, along with a miserable family, themselves all sick with worry. (Also, just in case it helps anyone or helps add some perspective and clarity: my dog that got very sick is a 20lb schnauzer female, 10 years-old.

"Two Heart. One Hope. This series is so great! Melanie Dickerson's Fairy tale retelling stories mix romance, history, and adventure together. The first book is The Healer's Apprentice. The adaption of Sleeping Beauty. Rose has been appointed as a healers apprentice at Hagenheim Castle. A rare opportunity for a wood-cutters daughter like her. While she often feels uneasy at the sight of blood. Rose is determined to prove herself capable. Future will mean returning home to marry the aging bachelor her mother has chosen for her  a bloated, disgusting merchant who make Rose feel ill. When Lord Hamlin, the future duck, is injured, it is Rose who must tend to him. As she works to heal his wound, she begins to understand emotions shes never felt before and wonders if he feel the same. But falling in love is forbidden, as Lord Hamlin is betrothed to a mysterious young woman in hiding. As Roses life spins toward confusion. She must take the first steps in a journey to discover her own destiny. Although Rose is not as courage as the other books heroines, shes more a bit old fashion compare to other characters in other book(perhapsI guess only a little) Bur she has her advantages, shes kind, she try her best to help her friends, and full of responsibility. She knew she cant be with Lord Hamlin because of the betrothed, so she decided to sacrificed her own happiness rather the good of Hagenheim. Besides all of that, shes a story teller!! How interesting! So for those who concern the shallow characters, I think its better to consider this book as a beautiful fairy tale rather than a contemporary novel.

"Anna Pigeon is a jack of all trades. Not only is she a park ranger with law enforcement training, but she's also an emergency medical technician and a trained firefighter. One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees, but quibbles aside, this is a superb book. Barr uses the drama of a fire to isolate her cast of characters in classic locked-room mystery fashion, then cuts them off from the outside world while Anna races against time to figure out who she can trust before she becomes the next victim. If there's a flaw it lies in the fact that a vital clue is a bit too obvious. I can't say more without giving away too much, but people who've read lots of mysteries will probably figure out part of what's going on simply from the way the story is constructed. Firestorm, however, is really a story of fire, firefighters, and the southern Cascades in the vicinity of Mt.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

This product doesn't come with its own case, but that doesn't matter because it's small enough to pack with whatever else you're using during speed training.

It comes with a two sided poster and a DVD. The DVD gives you a very good demonstration of several Lateral Resistor moves (in addition to the exercises you can do with other SKLZ products), and the poster gives you a six week program showing you when to perform these moves. One side of the poster is a workout program for the Lateral Resistor. On the other side is a workout program for the resistor plus many of the other SKLZ products.

Every SKLZ SAQ training product comes with the same DVD and the 2nd side of the poster is the same for each product. One side of the poster is always devoted to training with only that product.

It's a good accompaniment for a complete SAQ training program.",TRUE

Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

"Inventor, author, and futurist, Ray Bradbury, has done an outstanding job of describing the complex universe of the human mind. The book is both entertaining and enlightening, and it is a truly readable and well-written book. Bradbury is an American with an excellent knowledge of science and math.

Bradbury is a superb writer, and his work is well worth reading. I recommend this book to everyone. I am a big fan of Bradbury's work. This is a wonderful book about a man who is at the top of his game. He has a heart of gold and a love for his country. He is very tough, with good intentions. He is a man of courage, hard work and a determination to make his country a better place. He is a man of love and dedication. He is a man of faith and love.

This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too.

After about 5-10 minutes of flying, it came in for a landing, tilted a few inches from the ground, caught the grass and flipped.  Not a hard landing at all, and no physical damage.  On picking it back up, the propellers were spinning at full speed (with the throttle off) and smoke was coming out of the battery compartment.  I quickly removed the battery, and could see where the circuit board had caught fire.  So, this one is being retired after one use.  I'm not risking hurting someone or damaging property.

The powder options last much longer for keeping the smell away but they're just so messy. I end up getting powder all over my house from when I take off my shoes and walk around in my socks.

"The subject is the so-called Judgment of Paris--the blind tasting in which California wines defeated French wines and shocked the world.  The film tells part of the story: the efforts of the individual--Steve Spurrier--who mounted the event and the Barrett family in Calistoga, the proprietors of Chateau Montelena.  To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.

Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition.  Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.

Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically.  The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.

The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations.  All in all, this is a nice film.  I also recommend the often-overlooked film, Year of the Comet, for wine lovers.",TRUE

"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.

It goes well beyond a menage scenario as they continue to explore other fantasies. Chase and Zoe are completely uninhibited but the relationships begin to strain after a while.

It's well written and the complexity of the characters make it interesting beyond the sexual exploits. This is as sexually explicit a story as I've ever read so take that as a warning if that makes you uncomfortable.

"This is a review for the Disney Princess's: Sparkling Princess Series Collection by Mattel and Disney. Overral this doll is very amazing!  The doll has a golden sparkly crown, (Instead of a bow, we are treated to a nice crown) overall the crown is very satisfying, I really like the extra sparkle in the crown. Snow White's dress is gorgeous as well, the top part is blue with blue sparkles along with a red bow on the end of the top, on the top sleeves we have a puffy part of the sleeve that is baby blue with red color as well added along with it, kinda like a pattern. Next on the bottom part of the dress we are treated with a yellow sparkly color, this part of the dress is probably the most sparkled part of the dress. What I really enjoyed was the cool pictures of apples made out of the yellow sparkles, In Snow White she ate a poisonous apple, which was why this was included in the outfit. But I eventually found out in the Sparkling Princess Mattel Barbie Collection is that they also included different pictures symbolizing parts in the treasured Disney classics in the other dolls as well. The last part of the outfit is the red sparkly shoes, which stay on pretty nicely. Overall I rate the outfit a 5.0. Other than the outfit we have Snow White herself, who in my opinion is one of the prettiest Snow White dolls in the Disney Mattel Doll Collection. She has brown eyes, (Doesn't have much makeup which actually makes her look even more pretty) plain black hair, and pink lips. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the regular looking skin, which in the story she is described to have ""skin as white as snow"", which her skin isn't pale. Actually I bought the Cinderella Sparkling Princess doll as well and found out her skin was more pale. But overall it doesn't bother me. I rate the whole thing full five.",TRUE

"I have been an organic apple cider vinegar user for a couple decades now. What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it. Next time I went shopping I bought some with the mother in it. I am one of the crazy sorts that enjoy it straight up. LOL. However, I do add it to water most days. I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo.

"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died.

"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond.",TRUE

"We have a brave little dog that is fearless of most anything.  However, at the distant sound of thunder he begins to shake.  During a lightening storm he always has problems with nervousness.  We live in Louisiana so thunder storms are common. The July 4th fireworks celebrations also causes him a lot of anxiety.  The Thunderchews have worked great on him.  Within minutes it calms him down.  I didn't think it would work that well but am so happy that it does.  Our dog was pitiful during thunder episodes.

"Sometimes you read a book that you just devour. You inhale it. It consumes you. This is what The Perfect Life did to me.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise.",TRUE

"I vaguely recall reading some articles by Mr. Safire, but I've never read any of his books before.  Well, I shall certainly remedy that.  If Scandalmonger is any sign, William Safire might just be one of the most able writers in the US today.
Seriously, it must have been six months since I've last enjoyed a novel as much as I have enjoyed this one.  Written with clear, powerful and well thought of prose (In the afterwords, Safire reveals some of the tricks that he used in order to convey the atmosphere without falling into the use of anarchonisms), this book is always thrilling and often witty, for those of us who enjoy subtle, sharp irony.
You don't have to reach the appendixes in order to realise the width of Safire's knowledge of the topic.  Safire is clearly very well versed with the history of the period, and it shows.  Not a very descriptive writer, Safire clearly knows alot about the personality of each and evry character in the novel.  Writing with a Historian's dedicacy, even Safire's lies are rarely more than half truths.
The Pacing and prose of Scandlemonger are perfect.  It is a page turner, very well written and planned.  Safire never lets his grip loose, and every word counts.
The parallels between the US of the 1790s-1800s and the US of the 1990s-2000s are overwhelming, and surprisingly, you feel some appreciation to the history of journalism.  I think it is impossible to read Scandalmonger without thinking about Monica Lewinski, but the novel will still be every bit as good when Lewiski, like Sally Hemmins, will be left as no more than an ancedote in US history.
I can not recommand Scandalmonger enough.  In each and every aspect it is a masterpiece of fiction.  In one word: TRIUMPH.",TRUE

"These are very nice container boxes for the price (which at present is about $10 for a set of four). The build quality is pretty good  the containers are thick enough that they don't bend or rack if you twist it which gives me confidence that they will stand up to a good amount of use (and abuse). The lids are thinner, but still of good quality. The lids snap on with a firm snap so you know it is sealed. I am, however, concerned about the longevity of the lid snaps since they are all-plastic with just a crease line to serve as the hinge.

I filled one with various items and gave it a torture test to see how it would stand up. The lid remained firmly attached even after I dropped it several times from desk height to a tile floor, and tossed it around while it was in a laptop bag (in other words, a normal usage pattern for people such as myself who have a tendency to drop things often). No cracks or splits in the plastic either.

It is sized more for a kids-size meal than an adult. The overall dimensions are fine, but you cant fill up the compartments to the top of the lid with items such as pasta since the partitions do not extend to the top  they only extend up about 1.25 inches. That puts a limit on how much you can fill each compartment (provided, of course, that you want the food to remain contained in each compartment).

On the plus side, they are very attractive. The base is crystal clear and the lids (which come in four colors) are transparent. It would look just fine for both a school lunch or an office lunch.

Not perfect, but well worth considering if you're looking for an inexpensive set of lunch containers.

"I ordered this cape for myself for my birthday and it is amazing, I love it! I saw a similar one at Macy's that was twice the price and I am so glad I waited for this one to arrive instead, it looks even better than it does online. I ordered a large but the seller sent a medium (prob because sold out of large?) and it fits perfectly. I was a little unsure about the sizing based on the chart but I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium fits me fine. The fleece is high quality and slightly stiff, it feels almost like a wool. The stiffness will help the cape keep it's shape over time. And the collar comes up slightly in the back of the next which gives it a little flair and elegance, especially when your hair is pinned up! It is very high quality and the arm holes are in exactly the right place and provide a good range of movement. The snaps on the front are very sturdy and hidden when the cape is completely closed, no buttons or zips to ruin the sleek, simple style. I can throw this on with jeans and equestrian boots for a day out running errands, or cocktail attire for an evening out...this is definitely a piece that should be added to every wardrobe.",TRUE

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

"""The Winter's Tale"" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and it boasts one of the best ensembles of characters in the entire canon. This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.
The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes. While taking us on that journey Shakespeare glorifies the ideas of grace and forgiveness, the simplicity of country life, the lasting bonds of friendship, the power of parenting, the ardor of young love, the patience of mature love, and in the great character of Paulina, the lengths and benefits of loyalty. This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.
This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Read it, and then try to find a really superior theatre company doing a performance. Enter the kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia; meet Paulina, Autolycus, the Old Shepherd and his doltish son, as well as many others. You will be glad you did!
As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it.",TRUE
"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born.
There is also a tendency to leave things hanging.....
I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie.
I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth.
Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again? He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not.

"Keyboard cover review

I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.

The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.

I like having the cover. I like how super thin it is and the protection it offers. Typing with any keyboard cover requires some getting used to. I really wish the letters and number on each key were illuminated, thats my only complaint.",TRUE
"Elsa Quinn has been bullied her whole life, not just the kids at school but her mothers constant harping on weight loss has finally reached a boiling point.  Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Elsa joins a gym preparing to exercise the weight off.

Noah Stewart drives to another town to workout, as a football jock at school he gets inundated with his friends wanting to hang out while at the gym and he just wants to focus on working out.  When he sees Elsa, he wants to know why she is there, sure he has seen her at school but he wonders if she will tell people he is here.  Elsa though surprises him and realizing she has no plan, he offers to help her out.  At first Elsa questions Noah's intentions but realizes he has never been part of the bullying she accepts.  Noah doesn't plan on falling for Elsa though and he does, Elsa though is afraid of what going public will do.

I liked this a lot.  Noah's view on why Elsa is trying to lose weight is not what you would think.  Elsa is vulnerable, her mother is a class act and I can understand Elsa's choices.  Great read.",TRUE

"The story of Damali Richards is a bit cliche...the ""chosen"" guardian of humanity against the forces of evil...she's a girl who falls for the wrong guy...the guy is killed by vampires and becomes on of the walking dead...yadda yadda yadda.  So, what makes L. A. Banks' story so interesting?

The most interesting twist to the general vampire fiction rule is the approach to the vampires themselves.  As the most powerful ""demonic"" force in all of Hell, outside of Satan himself, the vampires are the undead elite...snobs, if you will.  Their views toward other preternatural creatures can be seen as a vague social commentary of our world today.

Another interesting twist to the story is in the character of Carlos Riveria.  What becomes of a man who willingly sells his soul to evil but dies with a prayer in his heart?  The battle of good versus evil in the war for souls just got personal.

While the dialogue is a bit heavy handed at times...too much street slang and ""hip hop"" style references to be considered entirely credible...overall, I would have to say that Minion is a great read and a wonderful new take on an old fiction theme.",TRUE

"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way).",TRUE

"Like any film instructor, I'm always seeking an affordable text for my students. With the average text hovering around $80.00 (and then the additional charge for supplemental books), The Lean Forward Moment seemed like a steal. I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewers here, I'm a bit confused as to whom the target-audience is.

The simple, jargon-free language appeals to the lay-person (which is always welcome in texts geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concepts give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn was attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious.

I know that it seems superficial, but one of the ways I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through its examples. I know (for a fact) that my students excitedly scan a text ... looking for stills from works they know/love. The Lean Forward moment uses many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choices to get the cinema-neonate involved. On the flip side, Across the Universe, Brazil, Synecdoche, Contempt, Coons, Jack in the Box, Satacracy 88 -- these niche/obscure works are interesting to more advanced students (maybe). (And, now we're back to that gray-zone ...).

-------
I bought this board in June 09. I was so busy in Summer that I didn't touch it until January '10. I hit the wall with my run and Nordic Track Ski Machine no longer 'shock' my body. Having stuck in the house during winter months doesn't do good to the body either. Hence, I was gaining a bit of weight. I put this board behind my couch facing the TV and ever since then - I was hooked. It took me about 4-5 days to start getting a hang of it(I never skate board or roller blade before). I held on to the back of the couch during those 4-5 days to prevent any falls from happening. Effect

After 2 weeks, I am close to going back to my weight in Summer. My waist is trimmed again; I wake up to sore gluts and core muscles - the best feeling ever! I am now a believer in this equipment and will use it a lot more throughout the year. Activities

I golf and hike in the Sierras a lot; both activities require a lot of core strength(especially when you start getting tired during the round or long hike). I started doing some core exercises about a year ago and noticed some improvements in both activities; more controlled golf swing and better posture during long hikes. I believe that this machine will strengthen my core more as I keep using it. Customer Service

"The Turning Point isn't as lightweight as it appears. Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other. Watching Mikhail leap through the air is indeed a pleasure as well; but I personally enjoy his love scenes and Leslie Brown's long arms reaching to the sky as she falls in love with him.

"I think like many book series, you can't start mid-series. I read many glowing reviews of this book and most of them mention the previous books. Coming into this fresh (I'd not heard of Joe R. Lansdale), the characters and the plot seemed very thin, although the earlier books probably established these elements. When I first started the book, it seemed like a strange amalgam of political correctness, graphic violence, and Fletch-like irreverence. As the story progresses, however, dreadful scene piles on dreadful scene until the book comes across as truly sadistic.

There is an ugly American (Billy) who seeks to humiliate a Mexican girl in the most unpleasant and crude matter. The reader endures many pages of this behavior. I suppose these scenes are intended to justify Hap and Leonard brutally assaulting this guy again and again and again. Finally, Hap literally spreads his own feces on Billy's face, beats him, and makes him stand in the corner. And then does it again. This comes in a scene right after our ""heroes"" discover a girl that's been dismembered with a machete. The reader is treated to an explanation of where the individual pieces of the girl are located about the hotel room. The graphic violence continues up until the final chapter of the novel.

Oh, did I mention that the book opens with a brutal beating of another girl whom Hap saves?  Unfortunately for the girl, Hap doesn't save her until after she's been repeatedly raped, had her face ""stomped in,"" her nipple bitten off, jaw crushed, teeth knocked out, and lost an eye.

Wow. Is this a fun read? I guess it's not my cup of tea.",TRUE

"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

"Schleich's North America Giant Volcano with T-Rex Playset is a beautiful piece of art and very instructional toy. It's immaculately detailed and textures are exquisite, especially on the dino's. There are so many details to point out and explain to your little one as you play together and I'm surprised by how much my little 5 year old loved this set. The bones were especially cool to see.
That said, Schleich's Giant Volcano Playset is a vinyl monstrosity that is a chore to put together very cumbersome to store anywhere. The material is soft vinyl and just weighs a ton. It came in 5 or 6 pieces and held together by these tiny brittle pegs that was an utter nightmare to assemble. Just a very poor design choice of material. Definitely bad if your little one is prone to throw things - each of the pieces from this set is hefty and will cause some damage. many of the highlighted features don't work too well or was embarrassingly underwhelming - ie: the ""exploding wall"" the wall pieces had to be assembled into the nook and pressing the button pushes the pieces over - kind of. The flaw here is that the pieces are so heavy, the notch of plastic that knocks over the wall can barely budge the pieces and they pretty much just slide down. The tree snaps just hasn't worked yet. The roots don't stay agape and the spring snap doesn't really do much. About the only thing that does work is the Dino jail gate and even that contraption seems over engineered.
Flaws aside, the set is very beautiful but alarmingly over priced at almost a hundred dollars. Ouch! I get it - it's vinyl and hefty and very detailed - almost like a model kit but $100 is just too much for such badly engineered play. However, it is great if you're a Schleich fan.",TRUE

Alas, I don't have one of the Eye-Fi aware models that recognizes Eye-Fi in use, but I don't care. It's great to be able to have the pictures you're taking on an actual camera--the phone has a decent lens, but it's a phone after all--get backed up to my phone and being able to share that directly to the usual places. I'm also pleased with the speed of data acquisition, by which I mean the speed of the card in storing even large videos is great, the fastest card I have.

"Don't ask me how they make money on this...it is a well-made product, and it cost me five bucks with free shipping. I don't get it! (And I ain't complainin'!)

I use it with my Kindle Paperwhite (2014). The fit isn't perfect, as it is designed for the Fire, but it works just fine. Inside there is a tab in each of the corners to hold down the tablet. Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around.

"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more.",TRUE

"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",TRUE

"I just received my feeders. I bought the 2 pack on Amazon. I just set it up so I'll update my review later once I've had it a while.

But for now, here are my observations. I have 5 cats. I find it hard to leave them for extended periods because it's too much for someone to scoop the litter and feed them etc. I boarded them once last summer. But it's not cheap and they are so trqumatized. I wanted to be able to go away for least a couple days. So I researched automatic feeders. I read all the reviews and some are very good some had issues. For this price for two, I decided to give it a shot...

Sturdiness: I real the instructions and set it up. I attempted to lift it by the lid just to test the sturdiness a little and it held nicely. I'm sure rowdy animals can get around that ... oh well.

Programming: Just like a clock, read the directions. Press buttons. It was easy. To test it, I put 5 cups in the hopper. And choose to dispense 1 cup at feeding.

Portion dispensed: After it dispensed, I measured the amount. It actually dispensed about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. But I've heard it sometimes releases 1/4 less the first time it rotates. So I'll see next time.

Sound: I was testing it so I stood right by it when it went off. Only sound I heard was the kibble dropping into the bowl. No loud grinding at all.

I am going to set the other one up and test them a few times and I'll update my review. So far so good...

Update: So I've had it a couple days now and it is dispensing what it says it will. Again, the only it makes is the food hitting the bowl. Cats were surprised the first time it did it while they were next to it. But now it doesn't bother them. So far, it's been a great purchase.",TRUE

"Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do.

"This is a good down pillow at a great price. I bought my first down pillow over 10 years ago after a lot of testing. No, it wasn't this one -- but it also was three times the price of this one.

When we got our Tempurpedic bed, I switched to the Tempurpedic pillow for a couple of years. But I wasn't able to lay on my side as much because I couldn't breathe as well. So I kept my eyes open for a good lower-priced down pillow.

I stayed at several Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn hotels that featured the Touch-of-Down pillow sets. Several times this pillow stuck out as my favorite. On one trip I wrote down the details to check into it later. But I couldn't wait so I ordered it while I was at the hotel.

I'm liking it. For an across-the-board comparison it would only get 4 stars compared to my earlier 5 star down pillow. But at one-third the price, it's a 5 star in its own right.

It is basically a pillow within a pillow, but only occasionally can I tell that. The inner section gives a little more support, but I don't know that I need it myself.

The only downside was that I had to buy the protective cover separately -- on my earlier more expensive down pillow it came stock with the pillow -- which was probably another reason it was more expensive.

If you really want to try out some pillows (down, synthetic, and mixed) try one of the Hilton hotels with the Touch-of-Down program. My visits have been on business trips, but they could be romantic nights out or any other reason. It's kinda like renting a car to try it before actually forking over the money -- a worthwhile expense.",TRUE

"And it's not easy to speak of these matters in contemporary America, but Baldwin's line about being pulled into the American family law system is akin to being tied to a truck and then dragged down a gravel road late is excellent. As he put it, no one can hear your cries, and it is not over until they say it is. I'm sorry that Mr. Baldwin had to go through what he did but hope that this memoir/analytical work sways minds and adds to the preponderance of the evidence concerning the lack of justice men now find in our courts of law. Protecting women is fine but the juridical operationalization of this notion has resulted in the persecution of the opposite sex. People need to be aware about what's going on so I'm appreciative that Baldwin is using his fame for the worthy and noble purpose of generating awareness. The great thing about this book is that the author does more than tell his own story. He includes the narratives of several men who experienced the same horrors he did.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.",TRUE

"As usual, Harry Bosch is a fascinating enigma; Michael Connelly is a master at the police procedural. It is New Years Day and a dog finds a bone in the Hollywood Hills. The dogs owner, a physician, knows the bone is human  a 10 to 12 year-old boy.

Thus begins an intriguing case that makes lots of hard turns. The murder occurred 20 to 25 years before and the victim was brutalized on a regular basis.

The case is fascinating, Harrys love interest and their relationship is not. Julia, a boot, is a mature woman who went through the police academy months earlier.

As sharp as Harry is, he begins a relationship with her rather quickly  even though it is against LAPDs policy for a supervisor and new recruit to be romantically involved. I just didn't feel that the relationship was real; the interactions seemed wooden.

One of the things that I like about Michael Connelly is that he isn't afraid to take chances with his main character, Harry. The case provides one surprise after another but the ending was a shocker.

"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.

"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you. Overall, a great buy at a great value.",TRUE

"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story.",TRUE

"I got this in the August Blockhead Box (a dog subscription box).  I have the ""large"" version and, for the record, my dog is an 83-84 pound Rottweiler who is super destructive.

This lasted my dog longer than a lot of cloth-covered toys (I hesitate to call it ""plush"" because it's not particularly soft and doesn't have stuffing).  As in, like five minutes.  Part of the reason was she had a bit of trouble picking it up, but I'm not blaming that on the toy, I'm blaming it on my dog.  She kept trying to pick it up by the middle, while one of her feet was holding the outside part down...anyway, she did eventually get it up.

My dog has the uncanny ability to find the weak point in any toy.  In this case, it is the embroidered KONG logo.  She started gnawing on that after a few minutes and I did eventually have to take it away because she put a few small holes in it near the logo.  For what it's worth, she did LOVE this toy and was sad to have it taken away, and it held up pretty well to tugging.  Also, although there are squeakers, she really didn't squeak this too much (for once, much to my relief...).

In the end, maybe this is not for the heaviest of chewers, but I have no doubt it would work for some dogs (like my last Rottie, who was very gentle with toys).  The large is appropriate for large breed dogs.  Although my dog is on the small side for a Rottie, I would feel comfortable giving this to a dog 20 or 30 pounds heavier, as well.  I would definitely supervise at first, especially if you know your dog is destructive.",TRUE
"Several of the science fiction ""classics"" I have read recently have proven to be rather less than classic for me. However, War of the Worlds is not one of them. I found it to be enjoyable, interesting, with an ability to keep me interested and engaged.

I was surprised when I started the book that it is NOT like the Orson Wells version of radio and movie fame. This is set in England at the end of the 19th century. This definitely limits the defensive abilities of the Earthlings compared to the movie. It is also part of what makes it interesting, because the Martians react much differently than the movie version as well. They are slower, more definite in their movements, and more connected between landing spots. Also, there are only ten landing spots for the Martians, it seems, rather than the world-wide invasion of the movie version. In fact, one area that left me questioning was what the rest of the world was doing while this went on in southern England?

The sample section of the book ""The Map of the Sky"" should have been left out, in my opinion. It was pompous and self-important, and was not in any way enjoyable, nor did it succeed in making me want to read a book that obviously was merely a ""tag-along"" story with little interest of its own.

The writing style was excellent, fast-moving overall though not without some hefty explanation sections. Grammar, spelling, word use, all are what one would expect from a consummate professional. I held off reading this book for quite a while after I downloaded it, in the fear that it would be another disappointing ""classic"". It was nothing of the sort; it is an excellent book of early science fiction, and a very enjoyable read.",TRUE

I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground.

"I have to agree with the above posters. When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

"While I saw the movie before listening to the audiobook, I must say that I still really enjoy the main character. He's one of those guys you love to hate, but he's trying so hard to do the right thing, even if it means defending a scumbag who deserves a lot worse. Of course, since I had seen the movie already, I had an idea how it was going to end, but couldn't remember the specifics. Perhaps thats a measure of a great crime drama: all the misdirection makes it difficult to know whodunit, allowing future rereads to be enjoyable.

But, back to the main character, Mickey Haller, I think one of the reasons this book was a breeze to listen to was because the main characters POV is so well written. You can tell that he has some baggage from his father, which is partly why he defends everyone, regardless if they're guilty or not. The fact that Haller knows his way around the legal system and uses it to his advantage to even get the guilty an innocent ruling just shows that he takes pride in his work, even if it labels him as someone who keeps the crime on the streets.

The plus to this audiobook was also the narrator, who was awesome in bringing all the different characters to life with his voice acting. Even if the story is told from the point of view of the eponymous Lincoln Lawyer, there are plenty of interesting people in this book, and each one certainly has a different sound to them. Its the attention to these details that differentiates a narrator just reading a book to you and a voice actor who can bring the events happening in the words hes speaking to life.

A great start to an interesting crime drama series, I give The Lincoln Lawyer 4.0 stars out of 5.",TRUE

The pieces are very cleanly cut and fit together well. They are soft but sturdy and will hold up to many robot builds. We went on to free build and found that to be really fun also. The possibilities are really endless with this set and I can see even teenagers enjoying building and creating different designs. Once the ogres and creatures are built you can display them or disassemble them to play another day. Fully assembled the largest ogre is about a foot tall.

"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.",TRUE

It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with the toolmaker, but your standard crimper may not work.",TRUE

"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price.",TRUE
"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

The strap does a good job of keeping the pack in place, and I like the quality. I don't have to pull it down with my hands, but I do have to pull it up and keep the top of my head up.

I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.

My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured.

During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book.

"This film tells the story of a brave young Polish girl and the near death experiences she has protecting the jew's she is hiding up in the attic. It is s great story of bravery.

However all said and done the acting is extremely bad, like sonething out of a 1950's film. Marrion Ross should have stayed in the yester year with Happy Days.

The Directors should have done their home work on the German regalia. Uniforms and emblems where worng. At about 1 hour 20 minutes into the film it shows a date Agust 21st 1944 and the apparent Russian attck which drives the Germans out. In reality this happened in July 1944 when the Red Army re-took Przemyael.

So although this film has good intentions the people who filmed in it should have paid more attention to detail and got decent actors in it and not made it look like a budget movie. Alot more care should be taken when depicting real life events.",TRUE

"These fit well. They tuck well. They definitely make hot weather easier to manage if you wear multiple layers.
My two complaints:
1) The collar is sized in a manner that often you are left feeling the tag of your outer shirt on your neck, which can be annoying, especially if you are wearing sunscreen. Sometimes this collar will ""roll up"" too. I assume this is from the type of material used.
2) Due to the material of the shirt, your outer shirt tends to come untucked, ballooning much sooner into your work day. This, again, is likely due to the material of the shirt, as there is minimal friction between the undershirt and the outer shirt. This untucking is exacerbated if your outer shirt happens to be moisture wicking (low friction at the underside, usually).
While I really do appreciate what these shirts do, I cannot imagine spending the same amount of money on another two. If the price was a bit less, then yes. However, for the money, there are a plethora of other brands that have extremely similar materials (literally two sides of the same coin at this juncture of clothing technology), that likely perform just as well.

I only had one hole that had poor pre-drilling, so compared to some of the other reviewers, I felt lucky. After the 2 1/2 hour construction, it seems like it will be a nice dollhouse. It seems good and sturdy. The ramp for the garage will likely fall off regularly because of the way it attaches, but its not really a essential element anyway.

Update
3 months later... I am leaving the three star rating.  The garage door ramp has never fallen off like I expected that it would, it doesn't attach very strongly, but the house doesn't get moved around all that much either. My son loves this house, and its played with daily. No amount of adjustments ever made our elevator work smoothly. It got stuck all the time, and I removed it entirely. It was bulky, awkward, and impossible for my independent 2 1/2 year to operate on his own. Luckily we have a super handy grandpa, who whipped up some nice ladders with some scrap wood and dowels, and my son has been much happier. Removing the elevator made the lower floor and garage much more accessible as well.",TRUE

"I was looking for a sturdy waterproof camera for my daughter. I wanted a good quality camera that could stand up to the mishaps of an eleven year old. She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allowing her to see herself. It is shock proof and so far it stands up to that fact as she has dropped it several times, knowing at times she can be clumsy this camera has given me the tranquility to know that this camera will outstand some of the abuse.

The down side that I have found with this camera is that it uses batteries and no charger. We fixed the problem by buying recharger batteries, which is great because she uses the camera quite a lot. Using a 2gb seems to go pretty fast, so I definitely recommending to get a bigger mini memory card. This will help from needing to remove or transfer pictures to another device. The batteries seems to hold for the usage, so don't be scared that it won't last long. Definitely recommend the product!",TRUE

"There is little doubt that Trevor is a master of his craft and perhaps the  greatest living short story writer in the world today.  After Rain, a  volume of twelve stories, explores such subjects as infidelity,  homosexuality, religious conflicts, and violence.  What makes these stories  so powerful, however, is not the subjects they deal with, but the portrayal  of the characters thoughts, emotions, and responses.  Trevor is able to  examine such human conditions as jealousy, rage, sadness, regret, and hope  in a non-judgmental light that leaves the reader looking into oneself to  gain further insight.  His writing style is nothing short of remarkable.  He is eloquent and simplistic, never revealing more than he should, making  the unspoken a compelling component of his story.

"First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observations are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials.

I bought these specifically because my snowboard garments (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capabilities (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx uses in the production of its garments.

After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garments are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with).

I have applied these to my leather shoes and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rains here and I don't wear my leather shoes during the few days it does rain. So I can't confirm that it works well for leather shoes waterproofing.

Pros:
1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes.
2)Easy application. Just spray it. It doesn't have any toxic smell (doesn't mean it isn't toxic). You need to let it dry for few hours.
3)You can apply these to leather shoes without discoloring or negative cosmetic effects.

Cons:
1)Hard to tell the difference between before and after. Maybe this isn't a bad thing.",TRUE

"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review.",TRUE

"Some serial characters don't hold up well after repeated exposure. They become a bit stale, too predictable, but Jack Reacher? Never! Lee Child is way too good at this game. He sets the hook then leaves little bits here and there, some obvious, some not so, but all keep the reader saying ""OK, just a few more pages,"" then a few more, and a few more. The narrative is first person Reacher, and strictly linear. There are subplots galore, but the straightforward style makes them easy to follow.
At the outset, Reacher enters the Pentagon with a target on his back. He's in uniform, an MP major, but scruffy, needs a haircut and a shave. He's posted to Kelam, a Ranger Base south of Tennessee where a young woman has been murdered, her throat slashed in military fashion. If this turns out to be a soldier killing, things will go very bad for the base and its in habitants. Reacher has an opposite number on the inside, Major Munro, also MP, but Reacher works, as always, on the outside.
He contacts the local sheriff, a stunning young woman who complicates his job by spotting him immediately. She's done similar work with the Marine Corps, but has made little progress solving the murder.
Reacher does his work in his own way, as usual, playing within the rules but just barely. I'll leave the rest of the plot description to the reader. No need to spoil someone else's fun.
In the end, as usual, Reacher leaves town, mission accomplished, a beautiful sheriff pining for him but knowing he's not a man who stays in one place for any longer than necessary.

"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views.

Ramsey has lost his family to a horrible accident and wishes he would have died with them.  Vessa has just found out her husband not only cheated again, but has been doing it since they got married and now he has some young woman pregnant.  After losing her temper for the last time, she withdrawals their money from the bank and moves it to another bank before heading to her aunt's house.  On the way she encounters a tractor trailer on its side and a collision follows.  When Ramsey gets called to the accident that mirrors the one that took his family he isn't sure he can handle it!  Enjoy as fate steps in to help these two move on.

Favorite passages:
 - She told me that this life on earth was just a test for us to go to heaven. She said that the true at heart die young because they don't need to live the trial like others.
 - This trip was about being able to forgive myself.
 - With you by my side, each day hurts less than the one before it.",TRUE

"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.",TRUE

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.",TRUE

"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it.",TRUE

Almost bought a Yeti but then found out that Pelican made a US cooler. Super solid almost tactical build.

  12 Non-roll markers
  24 Triangular colored pencils

"I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in",TRUE

It is between ""Lady Killer"" and ""Smart Money""  as follows. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter stars Alan Arkin as John Singer, who is deaf. Singer moves from a small town in order to be close to his institutionalized deaf and mentally impaired friend Antonapoulos (Chuck McCann). Singer rents a room with a family whose father, Mr. Kelly (Biff McGuire), is unable to earn a living due to a serious injury. His teen-aged daughter Mick (Sondra Locke, in her film debut) is at first resentful of Singer's presence, but he ingratiates himself by introducing her to classical music (which he can ""feel,"" if not hear). Singer likewise tries to brighten the lives of such unfortunates as alcoholic Blount (Stacy Keach Jr. , also making his first film appearance), dying black doctor Copeland (Percy Rodriguez), and Copeland's poverty-stricken daughter (Cicely Tyson). ??????????

"A comic novel about the love affairs of a sophisticated, thirtyish single woman living alone in a big city and working in television - sound familiar? If you haven't read Bridget Jones's Diary yet you may be more impressed by the originality of this. Of course lack of originality doesn't detract from entertainment value. Maybe we should just accept that there is now a genre/category (sometimes called called chick-lit) within which some authors chose to write. The heroine, called Jane Goodall is pre-occupied with a man who rejects her (plot lifted from Virgil's about Aeneas and Dido) and plans revenge (plot lifted from Euripides about Medea and Jason) which she does by writing  (derived from evo-psychology) magazine articles about why men are unfaithful to their lovers.

"Reykjavik, Iceland Film Festival, September, 2000.
I was not sure what to expect from this. I am a longtime fan and student of all things Yugoslavian. I had seen Makavejev's comparatively commercial film A Night of Love prior to screening two of his more obscure films, Sweet Movie, which is nothing less than visually frightening and decidedly disturbing, and this, Mysteries of an Organism. With more disturbing visual imagery and borrowings from surreal fantasy, the second half of the film is more like a ""film"" in that it tells a story of a Yugoslav woman, who, like all women portrayed in the film, is very sexually liberated, and claims that this is so because all women have been justly liberated by the revolution and socialism in Yugoslavia. When she meets a visiting Russian figure skater, she realizes that the Soviet ideals of socialism are limiting and lead only to repression of the self. She tries to teach him that love and socialism are not at odds with each other, but are indeed intertwined. When they finally make love, he ends up killing her because his passions and love have been so repressed. The first half of the film, which is a bit excessive and strange, is more documentary in style, but it does illustrate the points that are made more eloquently in the second half of the film by probing the life of a man (whose name i cannot recall) who was demonised by the US government.
The screening in Reykjavik was luckily accompanied by the director himself explaining his ideas and what he hoped to accomplish. This is a fascinating film, a total departure from American, or really, any other films of any genre or nationality.",TRUE

The picture quality is very impressive for such a little TV, although as other reviewers have mentioned, the audio quality is HORRIBLE.  If you intend to watch this TV often, I would suggest investing in a nice inexpensive pair of computer speakers....but this may not be necessary for casual viewing of news or weather channels.

"There are many (well, more than a dozen) cases in which a criminal suspect is convicted of the crime.  The defendants are often not charged with the crime, but the prosecutor is charged with it.  The prosecution team is a group of detectives from the FBI who investigate the crime.  They are sent to a small town in Ohio to investigate the case.  There they investigate the case and uncover the evidence.  The cases are prosecuted.  The case is eventually settled out of court for a sum of money.  The jurors are given a choice between guilty or innocent.  There is a sentence of six years in prison for the guilty defendant and five years for the innocent defendant.  The judge sentences the defendants to two years.  The case is eventually decided upon.  The jury decides whether the guilty defendant is guilty or not.  The trial is adjourned until the next trial.

"Be aware that there are only three Melies shorts on this disk and only one of them is in color. A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W. There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.

For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search ""melies flicker alley"" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too.

"This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.

If anything, the section on how the collapse of WTC1 and WTC2 was made more clear with the explanations supplied with the excerpted footage from Explosive Evidence than Explosive Evidence itself.

Where this documentary fell down was in the omission of Silverstein's PBS interview where he freely admitted that WTC7 was deliberately imploded, which was one of the few actual pieces of evidence given in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Myth-and-The-Reality-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000VRF4C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11: The Myth and The Reality - 2 DVD Set</a>.  The other glaring issue was the allegation that pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma were running rampant in the wake of the destruction of WTC1 and WTC2.  Problem:  asbestos-induced interstitial fibrosis and mesothelioma have very clear latency times of 20 years after the date of first exposure.  If such an epidemic is to happen, it will not happen for another 45 months from the time this review is written.  Also, mesothelioma already occurs in 1/1,000,000 people each year WITHOUT prior asbestos exposure.

"Whew, this book may be one of the most intense love stories that I have ever read. I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship. Chloe's best friend is a real hoot and I would have liked to learn more about her character.

Scorching sex scenes are an integral part of this book and Ms. Wolff does an excellent job of creating passion. Overall, a good read.",TRUE

I'm also a big fan of the suede shoes, and will continue to purchase them as I wear them all the time. I like that the suede sole is not too slippery, and that the color is a little brighter than I expected. They are a little too tight, but that's good because they're soft and comfortable. I'm not a big fan of the color, and I'm not sure if they'll hold up.

I'll be wearing these around the house, and I'll look for a pair of shoes that I can wear all day, no matter what I'm doing. I love the fit, the quality, and the quality of the leather.

"No historian covers financial subjects as well as Ron Chernow. This book on Hamilton, as well as his previous efforts on John Rockefeller (Titan) and JP Morgan (The House of Morgan) are thoroughly researched, clearly written and offer entertaining reading, despite covering complicated topics.

  One reviewer suggested that Chernow was more comfortable in the 19th century than the 18th and I suppose that is true.

  But this book, in my view, is superior to Titan. In Titan, I felt Chernow was to some extent a slave to chronology. He seemed determined to devote about a chapter to every period of Rockefeller's life. When Rockefeller retired in his 40s, Titan lost a lot of its focus. Rockefeller lived to be 90, and I felt a lot of the second half of that book was padding.

  With Hamilton as a subject, there was no way for the author to fall into that trap again. Hamilton's origin and youth in St. Croix are still shrouded in mystery, and, not to spoil the ending, but I assume most readers are aware of Hamilton's rather sudden demise at the age of 49.

  That of course was too bad for Hamilton, but it makes for a more exciting book. We see Hamilton as a grown man and soldier in the American Revolution by chapter three and then leading an eventful live that makes for a lively biography, when the author is up to the task.

  As Chernow most certainly is.

  This book took me somewhat by surprise. I don't know what is next for Mr. Chernow, but I actually was expecting, after Rockefeller and Morgan that he would do a biography of Carneige.

  Then his publishers could package the set as ""The Tycoon Triology""",TRUE

"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",TRUE

"My daughter and I love puzzle/strategy type games.  I hadn't heard of Kanoodle Genius before, but when we received the game, we knew this would be perfect for us!

The game consists of a small, compact box, making it great for travel.  The pieces are carefully packaged inside so that they won't get lost. This will be great for all our trips and camping trips, and doesn't take up much space in a backpack or suitcase.

You pick a puzzle from the book included, and then use the game pieces to solve the puzzle - both in 2D and 3D!  The puzzle pieces consist of textured balls that are connected in a variety of configurations and colors.  The texture made it easier to get the pieces together without them slipping around.

My daughter is almost 8 and we worked together to finish the puzzles.  She had a lot of fun with this game, as she loves puzzles and challenging herself.

This is a great game that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  You can play it on your own or work with a friend to get the puzzle done.  This is a fantastic addition to our game shelf and I'm sure will get a lot of use for years to come!

"First of all, it's NOT HORROR (JUST HORRIBLE)

Three completely bland, removed, uninspiring, predictable shorts that are too long and really give no real insite into the state of the ""American Family"". There's nothing thought provoking here, these shorts make an attempt to shock it's audience with violence that ends up doing nothing to add to or help drive any real message home. That's the peoblem with all three films from the very beginning you know what the message is (none being at all enlightening) and then are forced to watch a long drawn out story with no twists, no insight, and does absolutely nothing to relate to the viewer or to draw you in, 2 of which are ended with a scene of violence that utimately means nothing. The scenes are meant to shock but end up being just another scene that just happens to have blood in it. Theres no emotion, no character developement, it's bland and dull- uneffective.

Bottom line- 1.if you want something thought provoking this is not it. 2.if you're looking for gore and blood look somewhere else this just won't satisfy 3.if you're looking to be dissapointed look no further, this ones for you 4.

"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I highly recommend this lens.",TRUE

"**received a copy from author exchange for honest review**

Okay in one word is WOW. This is the first I have read from Mary Smith and have to say this is not your usual sports romance book. What got me about this book that made it so easy to love was its characters. I loved that you have a person like Meadow who seems like she is at the top of the romance world she is just like all of us waiting for her Prince Charming. The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there was so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what makes its characters so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model was genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio was hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear. Mary Smith just wowed me since this is the first I have read from will definitely keep up with her work. Get this book you won`t be disappointed from the camaraderie between its characters, the love between Meadow and Kyson even his teammaters were awesome. Can`t wait for Book 2 in this series.",TRUE

My daughter took this into her room once and came back out with a few pieces that came off. It was easy to put them back on. I can only think she tried to force it when one of the sides was slightly misaligned and that's what led to the pieces coming off but I haven't had that issue.

I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.

"This is the last book in the Learning series and it wraps up the storylines while providing one last emotional tug on the heart. Not to worry if this is the first story in the series youve read, this title can be read as a stand-alone, too.  Chances are though, you will probably be like me and want to go back and read (or reread) the previous instalments. Events in previous stories are mentioned and provide a tantalizing glimpse to the other characters stories.

Grace Hart is many things. She is a cousin, a daughter and a fianc. She enjoys her job, is basking in auntie-hood and is eagerly planning to walk down the aisle with a man she adores. What could be the problem? On the surface, nothing, but as Grace shares her past and the often painful memories she has, it is easy to see the serene faade is hiding a lot of pain. Jonathan Waters, her fianc, is loving, supportive and ready to provide the understanding ear or pillar of strength that is needed to help Grace through the painful journey of discovery she is on. He is sexy, dominant and a perfect partner to his strong, yet vulnerable, fianc. The writing style is natural and flows easily. A few awkwardly worded sentences were surprising but did not detract from a strong story and characters I really enjoyed.

"I want to give this story more stars, but there are a few aspects that I find too far fetched which brings it back to 3.

The story is well written, the characters are very relatable and easy to like. But my issue with the story is how so many characters have special powers or abilities for one reason or another. Yet, there's no explanation as to why. It's just - here are 5 people and they're all enhanced for some reason.... that will miraculously work to their advantage in the end. I love paranormal stories, but there has to be some reason or explaination or secret government testing or ANYTHING for that matter to explain why there are so many people with abilities.

Other than that, the story is well written to show how Jade is struggling to overcome her limitations because she's an empath. She's a very likable character and the author does a nice job of making you want to root for Jade you succeed.

I'd recommend reading the book, and am hoping the author goes into more detail about why in future novels.",TRUE

"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers.

"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

"For those like myself who wondered how a bunch of English kids had such a huge impact on pop music in the 60s and beyond, this book explains a lot - a first hand account from one of the most important figures of the British Invasion.  Keith talks about the Stones early influences and how they progressed from covering American Rhythm and Blues to writing their own material and becoming what many considered the greatest Rock and Roll band of their time.

Its a wild ride, full of sex  (Ronnie Spector, Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithful, etc.),  drugs (pot, speed, freebase cocaine, heroin, etc.), and Rock and Roll.

Only disappointment was that even though he talked about a lot of their biggest hits - Satisfaction, Start Me Up, Miss You, Jumpin' Jack Flash, and so on - he didn't say a word about Shes So Cold, which I always thought was a great song, and an important one because it made a statement - that after Disco and Punk Rock had pretty much come and gone, the Stones were still around, and they could still come up with a tune that was better than anything anyone else had out there.",TRUE

"The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic story about what happens to a foolish puppet who does not listen to the wise advice of others and who disobeys his unselfish father Geppetto.  From the moment he comes to life Pinocchio causes trouble.  He chooses not to listen to the Talking Cricket, a black-bird, a Parrot, and a Fairy with blue hair.  Pinocchio encounters a (supposedly) lame Fox and a (supposedly) blind Cat who dupe him into putting money in the (alleged) Field of Riches.  After skipping school Pinocchio narrowly escapes a vicious police dog and a hungry green fisherman.  Pinocchio becomes a donkey (Collodi makes good use of symbolism here!) as a result of his visit to Funville.  The donkey becomes lame after tripping in a circus act.  A man comes along to purchase the lame donkey so the animal's skin can be used to make a drum.  After being thrown into the sea with a stone around his neck the donkey changes back into a puppet.  Pinocchio is then swallowed by a shark and discovers that his father has suffered the same fate.  Father and son both escape and Pinocchio becomes a real boy.

The moral of this story is fairly clear: Our bad decisions and foolish choices have negative consequences.  Though this story is targeted to children (boys in particular) the lessons presented in this book can apply to adults as well.  The version of this story in this review is an adaption and is designed for younger readers.  However, adults will enjoy this wonderful story about a classic literary character and the error of his ways.  The book concludes with a brief biographical sketch of Carlo Collodi.",TRUE

"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.",TRUE

Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass. I'll admit I had a wtf look once Chelle found out Brielle's secret because I was thinking how in the world can she be mad when she's no better. Monique was bitter and wanted her cake and eat it too. Her response to KJ let me know she didn't have it all. Once the secrets started flowing it was like they'd never end. So much trust was broken but the very secrets that destroyed so much also had some good to come about. As always great job Toni and I can't wait to see what you come out with next.",TRUE

I wish I would have ordered the 16 inch length because I like the necklace to sit between the collar bone and the 18 inch was a bit too long. The name part of the necklace is really beautiful and I think the black one looks elegant. However, the chain is rather cheap looking and takes away from the necklace.

"In <i>Tempting Her Fake Fiance</i> we meet Stasia, a small newspaper reporter and blogger, who has just come out of a divorce. She is in Las Vegas getting an interview with the highly sought after Evan Stone. Evan is grappling with issues concerning his family needing him to be the man of the house when he meets Stasia. His guilt is what catapults him into the idea of faking their engagement, while in turn helping her build more confidence and shoving it in her ex-husbands face publicly. I thought the premise behind the story was great, but when it came down to it it kind of did play out just like a Lifetime Romance movie to me. Now as I say that it doesn't mean that the story wasn't cute, but it was just cute to me.  It had some juicy X rated scenes, but all in all it was mostly a demure chemistry between the two, that turned into a lovely love story.

"In comedy, TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  Subject knowledge comes in a close second.
George Burns' decades of entertainment experience allowed him to master both both aspects of comedy.  Whether working alone or with a partner (Gracie Allen, Walter Matthau, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Fred Astaire, Brooke Shields, etc...) George often slipped bits of wisdom in with his punch lines.  Sometimes those were the punch lines.  I could say he was at his best with this collection of TV Specials, but the truth is he was at his best each decade since he partnered with Gracie in 1923.  We can only be thankful George continued working after Gracie's passing in 1964.

"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!",TRUE

"First Impressions:

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

These are definitely a new favorite. The dogs like the flavor and I like them for two more reasons.  One is that they are soft, so my (greedy) labs don't choke on them.  The second reason is that you can break them into smaller pieces for training sessions and they don't just turn into crumbs like some treats do.  They are perfect for this.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in.

"I've never spent more than $100 on a pair of headphones before, so I can't really compare these to other high end cans, but I absolutely love the accurate, high quality sound reproduction of these headphones! Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience.",TRUE

"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container. Because of the size of mine (about 1 foot and a half each), I go thru about a container in a little over a month. Regardless, these algae wafers seem to make them happy.

"There has been so much anticipation and hype around Isla and the Happily Ever After. While I read it very quickly and enjoyed Stephanie Perkins ability to tell a good story, I just didn't love this one as much as everyone else did. Before you get confused by my 4-star rating, I'll start off with what I liked about it: the writing was well done, the pacing was good, the characters felt very natural, and it was very romantic at times (in a genuine, loving way -- not a sexual way). I read most of this book in about a day, and didn't feel like it was dragging at any point in the story. Moving on to the factors that deducted from the star rating. I just did not like Isla and Josh together. I felt that their relationship was not a healthy one and that they really didn't bring out the best in each other. I also disliked the Lola, Cricket, Anna, and St. Claire Cameos. For more details on exactly why these didn't work for me, check out my spoiler-filled book talk: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=F1wls-wRfdc

I can't deny the appeal of Stephanie Perkins books. She sweeps you up in these whirlwind romance, and by and large, you genuinely believe in the couple's love. However, there is always something that really detracts from the story for me. In this one, I just didn't think the characters were a good match for each other. Still a great, fun, fast read, but I don't think it's quite as good as it's often made out to be. For more book reviews, discussions, and book-related fashions, visit http://www. abouttoread.",TRUE

"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion.",TRUE

"This is a true ergonomic mouse. I work with computers for more than 10 hrs a day, previously I was using a logitech mouse but there was wrist pain which I started feeling.

Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months. So you have to be very careful while putting it in the computer and taking it out, otherwise it can become like mine (see the last picture).",TRUE

This story continues with us still trying to determine who the killer is.  As we watch Kate come into herself as a submissive, Jaxon is just the one to show her how much pleasure giving up control can be.  Their relationship continues to be steamy and hot.

But she is willing to play along so that she can be close to him.  As they continue to look for the killer, Kate still can not deny that she has feelings for her boss, Nate.  Nate seems to feel that he needs to protect her too.

"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try.",TRUE

"Best Laid Plans is like no other book I've read before. The story is action packed, raw, gritty and beyond entertaining. There are funny bits, and of course romance. But the best part is the two awesome main characters.

Stylo's writing style is one of my favorites. She captures your attention from the first pages of her books and this one is not different. At the same time, this book is nothing like her others. I felt like I was watching an action movie while reading it. Her attention to details and how well researched everything in her books is doesn't go unnoticed. It makes the experience of reading this book feel much more real.

The story is incredibly well written. The descriptions of the places make you feel as if you're there. The characters are intriguing, and captivating. Marc and Lily are headstrong, brave and they are focused on getting their respective jobs done. These two make quite the dynamic duo. They had me clutching my heart, laughing and swooning.

Not only the main characters are intriguing, the side characters as well. Kingsley, is I have to say, one of my favorite things about his book, and I'm hoping we get a lot more from him.

Honestly I've had better luck with the frog lures from the same brand.

Although I've not read the books before this one in the series, I think the author did a great job, I wasn't totally lost, but I definitely need to read the others.

"I can't say enough about this dress!  It is very simple but perfect in all the ways. I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40D bust and normally wear a L but went with the XL because I saw mixed reviews on how it fit. A L would have fit  fine but the XL works too as this is meant to be loose and drape. This fits perfect in the bust with a nice V neckline. The straps are adjustable and the comes up to the armpits so you don't have to worry about you bra showing and if you have a little extra chunk where your chest and armpit meet, this covers it nicely. this is very flowy and has a beautiful irregular hemline. The drape effect comes from extra material on the sides so if you spread it out it looks like batwings. The material is soft and stretchy, but you won't need any extra stretch. It is tapered just right to show off your curves and flatters any shape.  The shortest parts comes just above my knees and longest just below. I would recommend a lint roller. I will be purchasing more in other colors. Perfect for a hot day when you want to be cool, stylish, and comfortable and all for the right price!

Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product.

"Why do I love this show?

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

"I've used this for years on my front lights to welcome us home. In the driveway an infrared type light makes sense, but on the front lights using this timer in the automated setting is best.

Installation:
I fist use a contactless voltmeter to find the Hot Wire (has 120v current)  hooked up to the light switch and mark it with nail polish. Then go turn off your circuit breaker. Next go an connect the BLACK wire to the one which you just marked with nail polish. You will need to find your neutral, which is generally white and NOT connected to a standard two pole light switch. Just find the neutral and some white 14 gauge solid white wire and create a pig tail; then connect it to the white wire with an electric wing nut. Lastly, connect the blue LOAD wire to the wire which was connected to your switch. Sometimes you might have a green wire which was a ground wire. I just loop it around the screw as I reinstall all the wires. I also tend to wrap everything in electric tape as I go to ensure no shorts anywhere.

Go to google maps and get your current location, you will need the first two numbers of your Lattitude and Longitude.  Press the big frond button for 3 seconds to enter configuration mode and follow the single directions. It's mostly updating the year, month and day, next the time and lastly the latitude and longitude. Lastly I don't like the back light on all the time, so I turn that off. It still glows for 8 seconds whenever you press any button. I use the defaul P01 which turn on at sunrise and off at 11pm in your time zone and automatically adjusts for day light savings time.

I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

The only downside is that the range is limited. The lens is designed to be a wide angle lens and that means it takes a great deal of zooming. I wish it had an option to take full zoom and a 2x zoom. I did get a free item for this lens but I really don't care. It does what it's supposed to do.

"I found the Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutters to be very aggressive. The first one bit in, snapped one of the four teeth right off. I have no clue what broke it. The second one worked for a minute or so and then did the same. So far the third one is going and cut and removed about two dozen spot welds, but is noticeably becoming worn down. The initial aggressiveness has worn off.

For the money... I have found better spot weld bits and will most likely not reorder these as they definitely don't last as I expected. Sorry, but facts are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutter in Blister Pack"", the bits were extremely difficult to remove remove from the #13216 Arbor/Retractable Pilot threaded shaft. I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The threads are common right handed threads so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turns when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place.

Sorry for the negative review, but Facts are Facts! When they cut, they cut. But why make this kind of work more difficult than it needs to be. At the cost??? Well, I'll let you be the judge.",TRUE

"You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie.

"This was the 4th leapster game I gave my 5 yr old; she loved it at first. Played it ALL the time.  I was even addicted to it. Unfortunatly, like most games, once you play a long time and master the skills asked...there is little left to do.  The biggest drawback on this one is there is a store you can go to, to buy items for your dog after you earn coins throughout the game...well, my daughter went and bought out all the items as soon as she had the money to do so...then kept going back to the store and realized, they don't restock. So then she stocked up on like 50 bottles of shampoo, water, and dog food :)  Cute, but then she got really frustrated that the screen was really useless at that point and really never needs to go there again.

These dogs do everything, including ""Potty Time""!  Its a really cute game, just wish there were more upgrades, or updates you could download for it to keep the interest in it going.  It drives our cats crazy when my daughter plays it near them b/c the dogs bark all the time, they sound so real!

Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship.

"This Swedish comedy is set in 1970 and takes a look at life in a commune in Stockholm. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) runs away from her drunken husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), after he hits her in the face, taking along her 13-year-old daughter and son who is eight or nine. They land up with Elizabeth's brother who lives in a hippie commune where the members are all committed to socialism, vegetarianism, feminism and open-marriage but cannot agree whose turn it is to do the washing up.

The poor kids feel humiliated and estranged among a bunch of immature adults -- and their father's efforts to win back their trust only make things worse. But slowly they begin forming relationships with other kids their own age. Meanwhile Elizabeth is introduced to feminist ideas expressed by the radical notion of allowing her underarm hair to grow. We soon learn that behind the empty slogans of the hippies lies deep hypocrisy -- and we eventually learn what it takes to form a real community bound by ties of love and affection. Along the way there are many funny moments.

What I liked about this movie, apart from the Abba soundtrack, is that the characters change and grow -- and that the ideological points it makes are delivered subtly instead of being hammered home.",TRUE

"Eve Fortescue is back in Bellefleur, Lousisanna in hopes to convince Brent Bellefleur, groom-to-be, that she is the one he should marry ~ not Honey Moreau.  As a guest of the upcoming nuptials, Eve also has the uncomfortable pleasure of attending the pre-wedding dinner being held at the Bellefleur Country Club.  Here is where Eve is going to strike while the iron is still hot.  As she enters the country club, she latches onto the first unpaired male she can find and requests him as her date.  And she walks right into the web of Brent's cousin, Rainer Delacroix.  He makes her an offer she doesn't refuse and her seduction of the groom-to-be takes a different turn in the road.

Eve Met Her Match has a wickedly seductive kissing scene that leaves the reader breathless right along with the characters involved.  There are also some very swoon-worthy actions that make reading this short novella quite enjoyable.  The descriptions of each scene were adequate and well-written.  They don't bog down the story with useless details or babble.

At first, there is a bit of disdain for Eve.  I mean, she's only coming to the wedding to try and steal the groom away from a woman Eve used to call her friend.  Many of the secondary characters (guests that also attend the pre-wedding dinner) have no trouble seeing through Eve's charade.  It's perfectly clear what Eve's intentions are that evening.  Fortunately, she lands in the lap of Rainer, who does a sexy wicked job of seducing Eve and getting her to open her eyes and really take a look around.

This novella is sweet, sexy, and wickedly fun.

After weeks of getting him acclimated to the gentle leader inside, giving him lots of treats and attention, he loved it inside, but couldn't handle it on the actual walk. It made his behavior much worse- he would throw temper tantrums and just lie down on the walk, refusing to get up. After many adjustments, he was still able to get the nose part off every time.

"I bought 1 of these to compare against other bulbs because it had decent reviews. This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.",TRUE

"This is a fun and innovative toy that gets kids outside and exploring nature. My 6 year old had so much fun peeking around trees to see what he could find in the woods. He even had fun pretending that he was looking for Big Foot. The handles are very easy to hold, and the periscope is light weight making it easy to bring on a nature walk or hike. My 3 year old even had a blast playing with it. The periscope can be used inside as well to peek behind couches and ""spy"" on siblings or parents. That makes it a great toy for sunny AND rainy days! The light makes it fun to explore at night too so this would be a great toy to bring on a camping trip! This periscope is also durable which is a must when being used by little ones! I received the periscope from Educational Insights at no charge in exchange for my completely honest review.",TRUE
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie ridiculously boring and ill-paced.  I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.  This is easily one of the worst films 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesties as `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'.",TRUE

Growing up in Brooklyn I fell in love with the Brooklyn Bridge. I courted my future wife walking over that bridge several times in my 20s.

"I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

"I recently got this HTC Portamate PM1000 mobile base and a Delta 50-345.  The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.",TRUE

I like that the usb port on the front is a little wider than the back. I've never had any issues with the hub.

The other hub is a dual-core processor, but it's not that big. It's fairly small for my purposes. I don't know if it would fit in a pocket, but it's a good size.

"Love the saw.  Does a great job at a reasonable price.

My only issue is the manual, and it's probably not the manufacturer's fault.  It's the lawyers.  With this litigious society we live in, you can no longer get a manual that tells you what to do and how to do it.  It's always a long laundry list of warnings and cautions.  Due to this, it's nearly impossible to search through the manual on how to actually do something, because that useful tidbit was wedged between the warning about using the saw on a fluorescent tubes and the caution against hand-holding it to cut down tree branches.

I'm pretty sure that if all the lawyer-speak was removed, the instructions would fit on a single sheet of paper.

I've discovered that if I set the blade bevel at 45 degrees, if I were to actually turn it on and bring the blade down, it would shred the aqua-colored plastic table inserts at the center of the cutting surface.  I've spent a long time searching through the manual about this.  Is there another adjustment?  Do these inserts need to be removed before cutting a bevel?

"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.  I will come back to these in the fall and see if I can make them work.  Quality-wise, they're great, so no problem there.",TRUE

"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open.

"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?
While I understand the reasons behind the return policy on things bought from a third party through Amazon, I wish I was better informed about it before I spent money on this bra.",TRUE

Our daughter also loves the chicken and rice dishes. She has a tendency to just eat the chicken and rice dishes and that's fine because she loves the food. She doesn't like the chicken and rice dishes, but she does like the chicken and rice dishes.

"""Knowing"" (2009) is directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow, I,Robot).

"This little anime here truly emphasizes the very fact that Japan is quite obsessed with wistful visions of a fantasy-perfect high-school lifestyle completely saturated with glittery magic, action-adventure, and flawless  youth. Quite similar to the famous master of manga, Osmau Tezuka's  ""Knight of Ribbons"" where a young princess dresses up in a male  garb to embark on a soul-searching odyssey, Utena with her cotton  candy-pink hair and sparkling blue eyes dons a boy's school uniform and  dates the other girls at a very swanky academy school where young children  of the mythical land attend. Then Utena meets a very mysterious black girl  with startling green eyes and lavendar curls at a rose-choked greenhouse  where she tends to the colorful flowers. And Utena sees her get slapped  around. So she challenges the tormenter to a duel, which would take place  in the great ivory arena up in the heavens right underneath a floating  inverted castle. And wins. Thus the ""Rose Bride"" quite gratefully  throws herself at Utena's feet - much to her unwillingness to claim her. A  very misty-eyed fantasy tale filled with princely (princessly?) heroism,  chivalric romance, theatrical drama, lots of swashbuckling action, ideal  visions of innocent childhood and adolescent rebellion, and lesbian  suggestions. Quite sweet and fairy-like!",TRUE

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.

"I have never read Peter Mayle's ""A Year in Provence"" but I had heard of it, so I was interested in reading his newest ""The Corsican Caper"".  Apparently it is the latest in a series of short novels (this one is very short at 159 pages) whose main character and sleuth/trouble shooter is Sam Levitt.  Sam and his girlfriend Elena come to Marseille for the superb food, wine and scenery.  They stay with good friend billionaire Francis Reboul at his fabulous estate, Palais du Pharo, the biggest and most glamorous private residence in Marseille.  A dark cloud descends onto this gathering in the form of Russian billionaire Oleg Vronsky, who determines that this estate should be HIS, and is willing to go to any lengths to get it.

Basically, this is a quick little read, with a thin plot, lightweight characters and lovely descriptions of food and scenery.  For all of that, it is enjoyable.  Think of it like tapas...small amounts that you can savor briefly.  I would read more of these.

"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)

Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get:
(1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom.",TRUE

"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.",TRUE
Kate and her daughter live in a house that is falling apart around them. She was married for five years to an abusive husband. There is a mystery surrounding Joseph's death and his brother Ryan is holding it over her head. I sympathize with the h's that Anderson creates. Her h usually tend to have a handicap or dark past of some kind. The H is usually strong and protective and neither are disloyal or unfaithful to one another. Miranda is an adorable four year old but I have to say Chloe from Silver Thaw has been my favorite up to tis point. Zach McGovern is Katie's neighbor and as hard as Kate tries to keep him away from her and Miranda she finds herself caring for him right under her roof. The relationship between the two is slow at first but when you learn of Kate's first marriage it makes sense. What a nightmare she went through and with Ryan still threatening not just her but violence to her little girl she leans on Zach for protection. That is always my favorite part when the h finally puts her trust in the H. He does not disappoint either. The trouble I had with the book was it's similarities to Silver Thaw. The h in ST was nicknamed Mandy just as the little girl in this read. Chloe refers to the H as Mr. Jeb and Daddy Jeb. Miranda calls the H Mr. Zach and papa Zach. There are legalities to be dealt with in both as well. It is still a good read and the author takes her characters on their journey nice and slow so you really feel the bond between them. The love scenes take a back seat but you will still find it within. The healing and building of trust is the main point that the author drives home topped off with love. If you're looking for a steamy book this book will not fill your need as it shows the softer side of love.,TRUE

"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot.

This toy keeps my son busy all day, and he practically takes the toy with him everywhere (living room, movies, store, etc). It was also pretty easy to build, and didn't take him long at all.

"So far I'm really liking this hard case. I got it for my AK-47. I initially was looking for a soft case in the 25 to 35 dollar range,  but had trouble finding one that could hold the long 30 round AK mags in their pouches. I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can fit my rifle with scope and a magazine inserted into it's well. As my picture shows, there is room for extra mags also.
One thing that I like is that when it's closed, the soft foam really compresses around the rifle and holds it in place. I have shook the case and swung it around and upon reopening it, everything was still in the the original positions that I had placed them in. You also get nylon straps that you can screw into the case with the provided screws to secure your rifle. Honestly, I don't think that i will put them in because  of the aforementioned reason,  although it certainly wouldn't hurt.
There are four plastic locking tabs that keep the case closed and there are also places to put pad locks on if one should choose to.

"These bags are much larger than I expected them to be.  It's been a while since I've purchased some, but I don't recall them being so big. They do the job! Makes picking up the pup's messes a lot easier, and a whole lot more sanitary. Especially for my elderly father.  He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness. Some I've purchased in the past were a little thinner than these. If you have a pooch you need to pick up after, these are great to have on hand. They do have a slight odor, but I think it's just the plastic itself. It's not terrible, but is noticeable upon opening the box. They aren't scented with perfume, thank goodness!

In fact, I like these chopsticks more than other fancier sets that I own just because they are easier to use and hold food better.

"I Am Legend DVD

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.

This movie is based on the novelette&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>

"I'm amazed at how many people love this movie.  I can tell a lot of money was spent to make this movie, and acting was good but the story struck me as overly dramatic and uneven.  I'm glad the library saved me my money on this DVD.  I'll skip viewing the second disc.

Based on J.G. Ballard's novel, I think the late Roger Ebert summed it up nicely when he wrote:

""The movie's general lack of direction leads to what seems like a series of possible endings; having little clear idea of where he was going, Spielberg isn't sure if he has arrived there. The movie's weakness is a lack of a strong narrative pull from beginning to end. The whole central section is basically just episodic daily prison life and the dreams of the boy. Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances. But despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me.""

If you want to know what really happened read this passage from Ballard's autobiography Miracles of Life:  ""For me, the most important consequence of internment was that for the first time in my life I was extremely close to my parents. I slept, ate, dressed and undressed within a few feet of them in the same small room, in many ways like the poorer Chinese families for whom I had felt so sorry in Shanghai. But I revelled in this closeness. Lying in bed at night I could, if I wanted to, reach out and take my mother's hand. I flourished in this intimacy, such a contrast to formal English life.""

A fascinating subject I plan on  reading J.G. Ballard's award-winning novel, the sequel, and his autobiography too but I would recommend skipping the movie.",TRUE

PROS:
- They are indeed light, and very sleek. Don't look bulky at all.
- They have great sound. They don't cancel noise very well, but I didn't want complete noise cancellation anyway (I think it's dangerous when you're walking on the street.)
- They are adjustable.
- They are comfortable.
- They come with a pouch, offering some protection.
- They come with a 1-year warranty by Amazon.

CONS:
- They aren't foldable. I wish they were more compact, the best I can do is rotate the swivel ear cups to a ""flat"" position.
- There aren't that many colors to choose from.
- They don't look or feel expensive. Granted these aren't expensive at all, but ""lightweight"" shouldn't mean cheap-feeling plastic.

"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation.",TRUE

It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Oh, my, the writing. I'm not sure how I feel about this story. I had a lot of fun with the characters and the plot. I enjoyed the banter between the main characters.

Title: Phoenix (Cora)
Author: Kiera
Rating: 4
Rating: 4.5 stars

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak.  The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love.  I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book.  I loved the ending, but I wish there was more.  I have a hard time putting down this book.

I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.  Thanks for a great story.I was a little confused at first, but I did like it. I liked the characters, but I didn't like the way the story ended. I wanted to know if it was okay with the author or not. I was a little disappointed that the ending ended, but not that I was expecting. I thought the author was a good writer, but not a great author. I liked the idea of the book, but didn't like it.I am always a little skeptical of how this book will play out in the future.  I loved it, but it took a little while to get into it.  I think it is a great read, but I would have liked to have read more from this author.  I will definitely be reading more by this author.This is a short novella.

"I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Although the review I read in a magazine said that the grief felt by the parents for their son was incidental to the funny situations was not correct.

The thing I liked best about this book was the gentle and forgiving way the characters were written. Although they were ordinary and had many flaws, the author treated them all with dignity and respect. Often writers who portray ""ordinary"" characters make them seem pathetic and/or ridiculous. Stuart did not demean them for their ordinariness. The characters were real, and I could identify with them because of their faults.

She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.  I will be picking up the other books in the series shortly.",TRUE

"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

This was an excellent read and I hope there are more to come ... and soon!  Thank you to the Hill's for this wonderful series,",TRUE

"True to Kay Arthur's study of the relationship between the two characters. There is a strong connection to the two characters that is often missed by many readers, and the author is very clear that it is a relationship between Kay and Stephanie, both of whom have come to terms with their feelings for one another. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of it. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of the relationship with Kay, and Kay is determined to get Kay out of it. The story is not only about Kay, but about Stephanie, and the book is full of both of them. There is a lot of action, and a lot of twists and turns, but it is not the most compelling story. My only criticism of the book is that the ending was a bit abrupt. There was a lot of tension in the book, and the ending was not unexpected. However, the plot of this book was well paced, and I was very excited to read the next book in the series. I have never read a book that was so abrupt that I felt like I was in a story.",FALSE

"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons:
1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do.",TRUE

"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers.",TRUE

"When I first started this book, it was just not engaging at all.  Something about the writing style and the very slow start really distracted me and kept me from being interested.  It definitely picked up somewhere in the middle and builds up from there finishing with a very satisfying ending.  Not that it matters all that much, but this book has one of the best endings I've read in a while.
Though the story is very slow at times and pretty repetitive at others, some of the concepts in it are really cool and unique (for me at least).  Things like time dilation, major cultural and societal changes to the human race over time, physics, and economics all play pretty large roles in the book.  These are very well explained and really engage the reader, causing one to think about them in a way not really presented in many sci fi books of the genre.  Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that this novel kind of envelopes two recurring themes that are popular in contemporary literature; space warfare\travel, and futuristic dystopian fantasy.  While you are shown intense, high speed warfare in distant galaxies, the earth and its people are undergoing some massive changes and not all for the better.  It is definitely kind of an interesting dichotomy that once again sets this book apart from many others for me.
Over all, the only detracting factor that I can find in The Forever War is its slow start.  The characters are strong, though not completely fleshed out, the setting(s) are really interesting and distinct and the actually story from start to finish is awesome.  It's a relatively short read too so definitely give it a chance and see it through to the end if you can. I doubt you'll regret it.",TRUE

"From a play standpoint, this nerf blaster is one of the more fun toys to come out from them in awhile.  It has, to my mind, a bit of a HUNGER GAMES feel to it, resembling a cross bow as it does, rather than a gun.  And it's very cool that it shoots three streams of water.  Kids love that ""bonus.""  It's fairly compact, so it's great for a smaller child (7+, I would say) to run around and have some good, clean fun.

But minus 1 star for the rather silly marketing.  The use of the word ""Rebelle"" (yes, a feminized version of Rebel) is silly, and even borderline sexist.  It's done in pastel colors, so of course only girls will like it.  And the packaging only features girls.  I'm just not sure this makes great marketing sense, and I'd like to think if I were running Nerf, we'd find a way to start making ALL our blasters / soakers appealing to both genders.

"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY.",TRUE

"My favorite game of all time!  This game is so much fun for adults and kids alike. Some of the younger kids might need a little help but most of them were able to do just fine. You can even always make sure kids get the villager card. I strongly recommend watching a demonstration on youtube on how to play this. (The game seems complicated but don't be afraid. The  best part is that you don't have to memorize anything that the characters do - the narrator tells you as you're playing. )  We tell the kids that they are allowed to lie when they play the game and it kind of worries them to lie at first but then they really get into it and have a lot of fun. :)

You also use the one night ultimate Werewolf free app with this, that narrates the game for you as you go. You can customize it on the app as much as you'd like, including music, the voice, and you can decide which characters to activate during the game. You can also slow the game down significantly for kids or for those learning to play the first time. You can actually download the one night ultimate werewolf app before you buy the game to kind of check it out. Best. Game.",TRUE

"I purchased this for around $130 as a back up. I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund.",TRUE

"Do I really need to go back and watch the entire movie?  Well, I don't.  If you want to watch a movie that is worth watching, you won't be disappointed.

The movie starts off fairly simple:  the protagonist, who has been given a job by a woman who is a failed singer, is recruited to work with a female singer who is a successful musician who has been given a job by a man who is an alcoholic.  The woman is shown to be a young woman who is trying to get a job and she is not able to find a job.  As the story goes, the woman has a dream.  It is a dream that she has and she does not understand.  When she sees the dream she realizes she is a failed singer and she is not the only singer in the world who is a failure.  This is what she wants and the dream is the only thing that she can do to get a job.  She has a lot of good qualities, but her dreams are not true.  The movie is very well done, with some very good performances by the women and some very bad ones.  The story is very well told and the acting is good.  The movie is also a good movie and the movie is a good one.  The ending is a little long, but you will enjoy it.  It is a very good movie.  The movie is very good and the movie is a good one.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

"The movie's time frame, setting and plot are all similar to Command Decision, another fine wartime drama about air combat. But this one features a different cast and much more action. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier Gen. Frank Savage, who is given a critical task. In 1942 in England, early in World War II, he must restore the effectiveness and morale of the men of the 918th bomber group while replacing their beloved commander, Gen. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). The way he does so is tremendously difficult for both him and his men, but given what's at stake - possibly the outcome of the war - you can see that he has no choice. This movie was cited most often by members of the U.S. 8th Air Force as the most accurate representation of their lives and missions dramatized on film. Written by Beirne Lay, Jr. and Sy Bartlett from their novel, it is an intelligent, highly thoughtful portrayal of the stresses of command in wartime, and it's a tribute to the quiet but amazing heroism of the men who flew bombing missions against Germany. The 12-minute combat sequence featuring B-17 bombers against Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf fighters is incredibly harrowing and more realistic than anything else on film - because it is real battle footage. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Peck's top aide, and Peck himself is terrific, as are Millard Mitchell as the Air Force commander in England, and Hugh Marlowe (in possibly his best role) as a trouble-plagued pilot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",TRUE

"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.",TRUE

"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is.

The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.

"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like.",TRUE

Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire.",TRUE

"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

Would I recommend this cage?  Yes, I may even buy another one for ""cat tree"" use myself if they bring the white one back into stock -- cages in the livingroom are not exactly ""high design"" -- I'd like them to at least match.",TRUE

"Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles is called to a gruesome scene early on Christmas morning, where a young woman has been brutally killed and dismembered, with satanic symbols all around her body and the Latin word ""Peccavi"" (I have sinned) scrawled backwards across her bedroom wall. Detective Jane Rizzoli, back on the job after maternity leave, suspects a serial killer is on the loose when Maura's nemesis, psychiatrist Joyce O'Donnell, is murdered in the same manner. Dr. O'Donnell was part of a group of scholars from around the world calling themselves the Mephisto Club that track demons. When members of this group are murdered and Maura's life is threatened, the action moves to Europe in search of a young woman whom the Mephisto Club is certain will draw the demon to them.

This captivating thriller touches on a fascinating subject: demonology, its origins and presence in the world today. Gerritsen's outstanding characterization is once more on display along with a thrilling, fast-paced plot. Jane Rizzoli remains a strong character, a jaded woman whose marriage and baby have become a calming force. Maura is a lonely woman intrigued by a priest, and this relationship is a painful one for Maura as well as the reader, who longs for Maura's happiness. Gerritsen offers a galvanizing look at Rizzoli's parents, the two people who shaped her, which helps the reader understand her cynicism and insecurities. An electrifying read.",TRUE

"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia and Matt Damon head a super-cast of stars (among others, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle -both of them, second timers with director Steven Soderbergh from Erin Brokovich and Traffic, respectively) in a movie about... yes, the traditional robbery theme! Seen it before? Yep! Clooney (Danny Ocean), yet in another ex-convict role (remember ""O, Brother...""?), leads a gang of eleven experts to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Sounds like a familiar plot? Perhaps, but Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull off a movie that's very entertaining. Not that it's in any way related to the plot of the 1992 movie, but it reminded me of the movie ""Sneakers"" where Robert Redford gathered a group of experts as well...

"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!",TRUE

"This dres arrived dirty and extremely wrinkled, I know for a fact this item was returned by a previous owner or it was used on some kind of display. I received the dress the day before I needed it for my daughter so I could not return it in time to get another one. It had brown make up on parts of the dress, which I had to clean with make up remover and baby wipes.

The dress was extrely wrinkled due to the fact that the dress was STUFFED back into it's packaging. So I had to give it a good steaming job before it even stared to look decent. The same previous owner must have reinforced the flower appliques on the dress with a hot glue gun because there were dried glue strings hanging from the flowers.

The quality of the dress: it was ok considering that it is a child's play dress. Compared to other children at my daughter's school who also wore princess dresses, this one held up a day of playing, running, swinging, rolling of the ground/grass much better than the others.

My daughter did not complain of anything being itchy on the inside, which I was thankful for. I say that because the tulle fabric overlay on the outside is very stiff, as if it was treated/sprayed with a fabric stiffener or something.

"Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.",TRUE

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.

The first time I put it on, the dog stopped barking and started running. I think this has helped. I just put it on and it seems to be working. I have a 60lb lab mix and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a dog with a big head or neck and wants to work on their head.

I have a 14lb lab mix and I like this harness to allow her to walk with ease. It is a bit awkward to put on, but it is sturdy enough to allow her to stretch out while walking. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a dog with a very large head or neck.

"For this price, it's a nice size and the materials are good.  My only complaint is the extra large clamps.  I wish they were made of plastic, but it's not that big of a deal.

I'd definitely buy again.  Overall, a very nice quality product.My dog absolutely loves this toy.  She loves to chase it and it makes her scratch.

I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter.

"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.",TRUE

The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent.

I think the ending is a little confusing, and that's what makes it a little more confusing. If you want to see a movie that is full of action and laughs, I recommend this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one. I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action. It's a good movie, but not one that you'll be very happy with.

He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

"I've had the chance to read quite a few books that provide guidance and examples of how to become a better professional designer. After reading David Berman's most book Do Good Design, I find myself to be enlightened and newly aware of the social influence and ethical accountability of visual design.

David states that technology has turned the world into designers via personalized interfaces, computers, and cell phones which segues into the his core thoughts:

- Designers have more power than they realize
- The largest threat to humanity's future just may be the consumption of more than necessary
- Human civilization...can not afford one more major global goof
- The same design that fuels mass overconsumption also holds the power to repair the world
- We live in an unprecedented technological age where we can each reach a larger legacy by propagating our best ideas than by propagating our chromosomes
- Designers can be a model for other professions for identifying ones' sphere of influence, and then embrace the responsibility that accompanies the power to help repair the world
- Don't just do good design, do good

While I won't list all of the book's chapters (Amazon already has a TOC link), I'll highlight a memorable quote from each major section:

- The Creative Brief: Disarming Weapons of Mass Deception
""Designers can use their professional power, persuasive skills, and wisdom to help distribute ideas the world really needs""

- The Design Solution: Convenient Truths
""Imagine again a society's potential where the largest signs, the cleverest ads, the most prominent messages promote healthy behaviors....We can choose it now.""

- The Do Good Pledge
Immediacy - The time to commit is now
Ethics - I will be true to my profession
Principles - I will be true to myself
Effort - I will spend at least 10 percent of my professional time helping repair the world

I don't think I ever took notice of the magnitude of ads / visual lies that were around me before I read David's book. I HIGHLY recommend this book and I hope that once people read it, we can start showing the truth altogether.",TRUE

This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime.

"If you're a fan of the angelically irreverent Mark Twain, there's a *very* high probability you will enjoy this. It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.

Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughing-It/dp/1626360634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughing It</a>.

"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it.",TRUE

So I'm pretty amazed, I'd say the water clarity has never dropped below 90%. and I love it, This is a fantastic canister filter for the price, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good cheap canister, I really have nothing bad to say besides every once in a while I have to pump air out of it (I have aerators and live plants so my oxygen levels are really high) And it pulls the little microscopic bubbles through and they build up into bigger air bubbles. And one of my plants got sucked into the filter and clogged it (outtake was low flow), and the extra filter pads that came with were TOO BIG for the filter (I cut them to size). But as of right now everything works fantastic and I have no complaints otherwise. Just care for it properly, set it up right, and good luck!!",TRUE
"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two.",TRUE

"I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag.",TRUE

There isn't much creativity to it; it's as though they took Horseopoly and changed the horses to rodeo events. That alone should make it charming, cute, and fun, but it doesn't.

"I'll admit, it was the mention of a unicorn that attracted me to WARPED, so I was totally unprepared for the epic storyline that I discovered within the covers of this debut novel.

After reading just a few pages of WARPED, in which the Fates examine and manipulate the threads of life they rule over, I was completely dedicated to finding out what would happen next. The Fates have always fascinated me and Guibord's unique treatment of the related mythology was exceedingly clever. The idea that someone might steal life threads from The Fates for their own nefarious use... ingenious!

To add to the mayhem, Tessa finds herself falling for William de Chaucy, who is as alluring as he is maddening. I enjoyed the push and pull between these characters. They both have strong personalities that don't always mesh and neither controls the other... they're very much equals.

WARPED is one of the most creative YA contemporary fantasy novels I've ever read. Guibord combines magic, time travel, and mythology to create a fantastic story with a convincing villain and a much deserved happily ever after.",TRUE

"In his later years, Welles often complained that he spent more time trying to find money to make films than he did actually making films. And seeing Welles still scrambling for cash in his last days as a commercial pitchman for such products as Dark Tower and Paul Masson Wines (""Where we will sell no wine before it's time""), you know he was right.
This entertaining and exhaustive book by Simon Callow doesn't deal with most of his film career - only covering up to 1941. (We're still waiting on part two to cover the rest. Simon? Simon?). However, what it does do is clear up much of Welles' confusing past (he often told conflicting stories in interviews) and delve into the two main works that set Welles up for stardom...and the fall...in Hollywood - The War of the Worlds radio broadcast and Citizen Kane. And no wonder they were sharpening knives for the boy wonder when Welles publicly put down the Hollywood community, his Kane script bit the hand that feeds him by taking obvious shots at newspaper mogul Randolph Hearst and he was given the kind of directorial freedom veteran directors could only dream of.
Some people may tire of reading about Welles' theatre days with Houseman, anxiously waiting to get to the meat of his film career. But to understand why Welles became a ""has-been"" at 26 and the long slide to come, this is required reading.",TRUE

"If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.",TRUE

It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2.

"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.",TRUE

The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!

"I love this hydration engine, but like a lot of people I hated that it would lose air pressure so quickly. It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal.",TRUE

"My primary use for this toolbox is to keep inside of my truck.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother. I can look in my box and see exactly what i need and where it is. No more moving stuff around to get at the tool that I need.

"In CARNAL INNOCENCE author Nora Roberts has created a mesmerizing tale of madness, murder, and love in a small southern town of the bayou.  Put into play is Caroline Waverly, a beautiful world renowned concert violinist who is still fragile from both a public breakup and private breakdown after witnessing her lover with another.  Caroline, has left the concert circuit escaping to her late grandmothers home in Innocence, Mississippi.  However instead of the peace and tranquility she expected, she found a town reeling from two vicious and heinous murders. And, if that weren't enough Caroline discovers a third victim on her property.

Enter Carolines devastatingly handsome bad-boy neighbor - Tucker Longstreet.  Big, beautiful with a devilish grin and the sexiest southern drawl ever.  But for some reason, Tucker makes Caroline feel safe even though his reputation for breaking hearts has put him at the top of the suspect list, seeing as how he was connected to each of the murdered women.

***  Lordy, lordy, but I have listened to Tom Stechschulte before and I have to say that NO ONE does sexy Southern drawls like Mr. Stechschulte!  He is a master of making a written hero pop to life as one very SEXY heart throb - just by hearing that rich southern interpretation.  Wow!  And let me also say that the sensuality both actual and implied was steaming all the way through to the very end!

Now mix that with exquisite storytelling by Nora Roberts and you have a perfect combination that will force you to keep listening way into the middle of the night and then turning it back on as soon as you wake up!  Be it children, heroes or heroines, pets, even nasty villains  - Ms. Roberts writes the books that grab you and simply won't let you go.  Loved every minute of this audiobook, the outstanding performance of Mr. Stechschulte and the entire cast of characters who made this very hard to put down  and immensely satisfying book!

It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lies it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin lines of nuance while David Norse was achingly fragile and volatile.
Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating. I think this is one of them. The language and violence in this film are wholly appropriate to the subject matter, and thankfully, all other offensive content was cut during the editing process.

"King has a natural (maybe supernatural) talent of writing horror novels. Everyone knows that. What a lot of folks don't know is he is one of our generations greatest writers period taking genre out of the equation. I've never read a novel that jumps back and forth to two timelines that I've enjoyed...until now. King does it effortlessly and fluidly. Also the story itself is so absorbing I had a hard time putting this book down each night. Childhood and childhood fears are two things King does great with and this story is no exception. The young characters come to life instantly. Its easy to picture each one. With all that said, this is perhaps the scariest novel I've ever read. One novel comes to mind that trumps this one in the scare department and its not King. It was immensely spooky because it dealt with not only childhood fears, which we can all relate to, but an evil of magnitudal proportions.

"Thunderbolt transfers are ridiculously fast compared to Firewire and USB -- 10 gbps -- and are incredibly handy when working on the fly with large files. It's an excellent choice for large video, photo, and audio files. It can be daisychained, too, so you can have multiple adapters setup for one machine (ultimate efficiency and speed!).

Unfortunately, no cable is included - so this can become an expensive upgrade pretty quickly.

"In cycling, White is the new Black right now. White bikes, white saddles, white stems, and even white handlebars covered in (and completely obscured by) white tape. My new mountain bike - designed to spend most of its life in the dirt - is painted white. Obviously there are problems with this trend. Within 6 months of getting my road bike, the white tape it came with was starting to yellow and deteriorate. I had seen a positive review online of the DSP bar tape and a local shop also recommended it as well, so I decided to give it a try.

I have only been using the tape for two months, but at this point I couldn't be happier with the product. In fact, I just ordered more to put on my cyclocross bike. The extra thickness of the DSP tape helps make rough roads more pleasant. Also, the synthetic material remains easy to grip even with damp or sweaty gloves. I can't tell much about durability at this point, but I suspect the extra thickness will lead to a longer life for this bar tape as well.

The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be.

"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it?

The camera bag has plenty of pockets and holds two lenses and several lenses.  The bottom line is the Tamrac 3385 is a great addition to your camera bag.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive, compact, and well made bag.I got this for my son's old laptop.  He loved it and it fits great.  He uses it every day.

Love these wipes!  My dog has been using them for a month now and they smell great!  I have not had any issues with fleas but the spray does not take up much of the smell. It does not clump on the carpet as I expected. The only thing I would say about these is that they are a bit big for a dog that is a bit small for a puppy. I like the fact that they are not all that hard to put on and it is easy to clean. The only thing I would say is that I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a long lasting brush.,FALSE
"Alright, the shipping is dumb... I'm sure everyone is used to that now.  But, this thing WORKS.  I don't live in a jungle, but I figured an 8 dollar machete would work on all the thorny vines that infest the campsite I use.  It did that and more.  I cut down saplings as well.  The edge isn't razor sharp, but I could probably help that along.  For 8 dollars though, well beyond what I expected.  Only problem I had was learning where the blade needed to strike my intended thorny prey when rooted in the ground.  Other than that just swing around, works just fine.  Sheath is decent as well.",TRUE

"I purchased this scope to use on my AR-15. I also have a 22 round barrel (22LR) and I am using this scope for a 22lr AR-15. The scope is very well made and it was easy to install and holds my AR-15 perfectly. The scope is also very compact and I can use it on my AR-15 without any problem. This scope is very bright and accurate. I have a good sight picture on this scope. I highly recommend this scope. I will definitely be buying more from this company. Good quality, and good price. A must have for any mount. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was a huge fan. It is bright and easy to install. I will be buying another one for my son soon. Love the design of this bag. It is small and compact, but well made and stylish. I will order another one.",FALSE
"I purchased the Inova BB-R15C and the Bosch T-60 for my new home. The other two have the same design, but the Bosch T-60 is slightly larger than the Inova and the Bosch is slightly smaller. I have not used the Bosch T-60 yet. I have read the reviews and I can tell you that I like the Bosch T-60 better than the Inova. But the Bosch T-60 is very similar to the Inova in size, shape, and function. I am very pleased with this purchase.

The Bosch T-60 is a very well-made tool. I have used it for a long time and have never had a problem. I can say I am very satisfied with the Bosch T-60.

I have purchased many different tools for my projects. I have had this tool for over a year and have never had a problem. I have read the reviews and I can tell you that the Bosch T-60 is very similar to the Inova. I would highly recommend this tool to anyone.I bought this to replace the old one that came with the CZ-1S.  It is very sturdy and has a very solid feel.  The spring is very stiff, so it will hold a charge for a long time.  It does take a little practice, but it is a very effective tool.  I like that it has a good selection of features, which makes it easy to use.  It is a very good buy.  I would recommend this tool for any project that requires some additional tools.I bought this to replace the old",FALSE

"I wanted higher capacity than this. The only problem is that it's only 2. 5"" diameter. If you want to use your iPad with this, you'll need a 4"" diameter. The only way to get this size is to use the iPad with an adapter. I haven't used it with a portable player, but I'll try it with a portable charger. Update: This review has been updated with an additional review. This product is great, it works great, it works, it has a really nice feel and it fits great. Pros:
-Good quality, great sound
-Convenient to have a usb port on the front
-Good value for a small compact device
-Good price
-Convenient to have a usb port on the front

Cons:
-The sound is terrible, the volume is terrible, the battery life is horrible, and the battery is a little short. I'm going to try and replace this with a mini USB charger, but I'll be getting another one soon. I have not used this product in a remote control unit or anything else, and I have not tried it with any of the other devices I have tried. I have also tried it with a tablet and a small laptop.

"I suppose you could use this to make an ice cream cone, but that would be a bit difficult.  I had to get a solid ice cream cone out of the box, and that worked out well.  I would definitely buy this again.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I was very disappointed. It's not very sharp, but it's nice to have a little bit of a sharper edge on your knives. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of knives, so I would highly recommend it.  I was just looking for a nice, sturdy knife. I have used it a couple of times, and it's still working fine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality knife. I've had no problems with this knife. I have used it for almost a month now. I've used it a lot, and it's not really the sharpest edge. It's just a little sharper than the one I had before. The other one I have is a little less sharp, but I would say it's still great for cutting very sharp fruit. I would also say that it's very comfortable for me. I've tried several other knives and this one is the sharpest one I've ever used. I've tried many different knives and this one is the sharpest one I've ever used.I received this item as a gift.

"This is the final book in the Trilogy of ""Oryx and Crake"" and ""Year of the Flood"". I believe if you had not read the first 2 novels in the series you would not really enjoy this final book - you would miss so much. Yes, Ms. Atwood does refer back to the other 2 books to explain, but there is just so much to connect to - as much of a feeling of the other 2 books, as just details

This 3rd novel is about the survivors of the waterless flood gathering together for strength against their common enemy,the Painballers. Toby and Zeb have the largest parts in this book. They take the most chances to save the remaining survivors and the Crakers (recombined DNA humanoids). Toby's nightly stories to the Crakers  are full of both sadness and humor  - because the Crakers are so peace-loving that they almost seem like small children.

This is not as action-packed as the other 2 novels - it is a winding down and a closing. I really enjoyed it though - especially Toby's comments and explanations to the Crakers  :)",TRUE
"Needed a pair of jeans as I've put on some weight and have tons of jeans just sitting in my closet.  As I'm working on losing the extra pounds, can't walk around without bottoms so, looked for some reasonable priced jeans and these fit the bill.  Had enough stretch without bagging.  The length was perfect as I'm not short nor too tall, but sometimes have an issue with the length being too short for regular.  It held up very well to washing and was a bit tight on the first wear, but loosened up very quick.  The are flattering and very easy to move in.",TRUE

"BEAUTIFUL TRANSFER! Nice war time musical. Carmen shows her comedy side in this film and of course her over the top outfits! I won't go into the story line. If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL. Michael O'SHEA looks a little too old and his uniform is a few sizes too small...to bad they didn't cast PERRY COMO in this leading role. Also O'SHEA is not the best singer either...most all other cast members do a great job...EXCEPT...PHIL SILVERS who is loud and ANNOYING!
Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer. Only problem I had is in the EXTRA FEATURES: The ""STILL GALLERY"" feature in my copy doesn't allow my access to it...used two different DVD players and both had the same problem. The Film, Scenes, Trailer, and the SUPERB DOCUMENTARY are no problem. The documentary is in four parts...great interviews, vintage still photos and live performances, both candids and her FOX production numbers make this one of the best Documentaries out there...the Documentary is worth the price of this DVD ALONE! I give it 5 STARS...the 'still' problem may be in MY COPY ONLY...(don't let this deter you from puchasing this film). A MUST HAVE for the CARMEN MIRANDA FAN! THANK YOU FOX!!!",TRUE
