"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling.",TRUE

In addition, Spiegelman notes that the author has a very good knowledge of the history of the period",FALSE

One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).

"This book was a recommendation of my reading group. Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.

I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight.

"I bought the Inferno somewhat reluctantly because of all the negative reviews.  But since I have loved all of Brown's previous books, it seemed worth a chance. I am an avid reader of nonfiction - have a library of thousands - and occasionally read fiction recreationally. Brown is one of the few fiction writers that I enjoy, because he so elequently sets the scene of his stories, and describes the locations in great depth. These are usually places that I will never see, but definitely would have, if the circumstances of my life had been different. It seems that this has been a problem for many reviewers, but for me, it is one of the many reasons that Brown's books never fail to enchant me.

The next issue that appears to have bothered some reviewers was the topic of overpopulation.  This has been addressed often by scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, among others, and yet I don't hear it discussed among the general population as more than a passing topic. It is as though the subject is of no concern to most people. But to make it the subject of a novel, by such a renowned writer, people will become more aware, and perhaps even research the issue... and who knows...  even do something about it.

That was what I experienced when The DaVinci Code was on the best seller lists. Everywhere I went people were talking about it. Some were appalled by the ideas Brown put forth, but many were fascinated by the ideas and were researching the early Christian era to find out more about it.

I have always had an interest in the Divine Comedy, and so, really appreciated reading a novel that featured it so highly. Also, Brown certainly had me on the edge of my seat with all the dramatic chase scenes and all the unknowns such as his amnesia.

All in all, I have to say that I loved the book and will probably read it again, as well as recommend itto others.",TRUE
"Having read and thoroughly enjoying Bernstein's earlier biography of Thomas Jefferson, I decided to give THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS, a look. Like his earlier work, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson, however this book is geared towards the school age reader. Much of the text is identical to the earlier biography. The most significant difference is the addition of dozens of illustrations, from portraits of Jefferson's friends, family, and foes, and political cartoons. My single knock on Bernstein's book is the same knock I had on his previous work. Bernstein adamantly portrays Jefferson as a ""strict separationist"", which in and of itself is accurate. However he fails to recognize that what constituted a ""strict separationist"" 200 years ago is much different than the definition given in today's climate of political correctness gone awry. Bernstein seems genuinely perplexed that Jefferson ""sent Christian missionaries to establish schools in western territories to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity. "" As with extremists today, Bernstein fails to understand that Jefferson's actions did not violate the First Amendment in that ""Congress made no law respecting the establishment of religion. ""

I could spend all day writing about how mixed up people are about what the First Amendment means and how it was intended by our framers, but that strays from the subject at hand. All in all, this is a great introduction for school children and should capture their interest and perhaps, lead them into more indepth study of one of our greatest leaders. Monty Rainey

"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.

"I am assuming that if you are reading this review you have at least read the synopsis of the book and know what the story is about so instead of summarizing I am going to list the things I did and did not like.

The good:

-The characters are great. They are charming and funny and I love that they focus so much on  family obligation

-The authors paint a wonderful picture of small town life

-There is a mixture of humor and more serious things going on within the story.

The not so good:

-There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. A lot of mixed up he/she. There were also times that words were used in an unrealistic way. I don't think any woman has ever thought that she would like to feel a mans cock against her integument, though that is just my opinion.

-There was tons of unnecessary details given. I don't need to know that he turned the shower on, then checked the temp, then got in, then picked out a shampoo, then picked out a body wash and on and on it goes. The story could have been cut in half without losing anything of importance.

-pov jumped around a lot which is usually good but there was no real flow to it.

-There was just too much going on. The focus should have been primarily on Quinn and Mhisery with Chance getting his own book. The little glimpses of other people seemed out of place as well.

-It often felt like rather than reading a story things were being ""explained"" and there was too much repetition and even some inconsistency. He goes down on her at one point and then later is surprised that she is pierced there?

These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym.

One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) that has one of Buddy's classic solos.  This sequence alone makes the DVD worth getting. An added bonus is the included soundtrack on CD that comes with the DVD.

"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area.",TRUE

"I received a defective unit (zoom lens stopped working after an hour), and have had the replacement since December, 2015.  So far, everything is working as of February 7, 2016.  The design and features of this camera are impressive.  There are so many functions and modes that it would be hard to learn all of them, but the layout and menu are such that it is easy to access the features you will need and use, and there are 5 buttons that can be programmed to access your most used menu features.  The only ""cons"" I would mention are:
(1) There is a slight motor noise present as soon as the camera is turned on.  Panasonic says this is normal and needed to support the Image Stabilization, Focus and Zoom functions, but this noise is picked up by the built-in stereo mike during video recording modes.  I wonder about the life of a motor that's on all the time.

I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

"My dogs are fairly rough on toys - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both).

This ball is not solid, and it is not durable.

The ball looks exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category.",TRUE

"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it!

Let me start out by stating I bought this as a gift for my brother. It gets points for the outside appearance and the fact that it has actual glass and not cheap plastic. The latch is okay. It does the job but could be improved in quality.  On the inside the is where it appears cheap to me and how you hve to set up the dividers.  I think they were aiming for you to be able to customize the set up but it comes off cheap to me. The dividers feel like the re little more than felt covered cardboard. Maybe I didn't read the discription fully I will have to recheck but I thought the diveiders were built in and that is why I was most disappointed.  I do like the fact that the cushions are removable because that mens you can store more than just watches in this case. It works well for almost any men's jewelry. I went ahead and gave three stars because if it wasn't for the dividers I would have been pleased with the purchase and maybe a better latch.  Needs to be better priced for what it is though.

"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!",TRUE

"I bought these despite a previous reviewer concerned with the ""cheap plastic"" not being able to ""dissipate heat"".  The  reason you SHOULD by these lights is because there's no heat to dissipate! That's the beauty of LED's: instead of making light and heat like the halogen lights we're replacing, LED's just make light, hence the energy savings. BTW., if the reviewer is that worried about heat dissipation, he should hurry up and get these because the old halogen lights in recessed ceiling cans get way to hot for my comfort level. Even the heat protection devises to make them safe for installation in attic spaces don't do that good of a job.

Not sure why he had such failure. I'm not sure if LED's can be used outside, in wet exposures. Curious to know how the guy who said they fit in the Malibu (exterior) lights from the boxed store are holding up! I hope well...these would save me a ton of money if I can replace those as well!!",TRUE

Skylar finds Rusty murdered in his own bed with her knife and all evidences clearly makes Skylar appear to be guilty therefore; she becomes a target for the Devil Kings MC.The author did an exceptional job with this novel and I love it. I connected very easily with the main characters. I found this book to be fast paced and really enjoyed the scenes between the two of them as they got more and more involved with each other as well as handling difficult situations.

Then when the ending came I thought it was well played out and very enjoyable. I highly recommend this story it's definitely a must read!!!",TRUE

"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right.",TRUE

"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside.

This was a pleasure to read. The amount of research the author did for this book is astounding. She didn't just take liberties on writing something in 1812 and do with it as she pleaded.

The main character was great in that she was consistent and stayed true to the time. Which I find greatly appreciated. And all of the side characters were wonderfully done as well.

Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!

"(Source: I receieved a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to author Kris Kreisman.)
Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

"This is a whole new way of looking at wood building and other projects. I also bought a fancy jig system, then realized this adhesive is the only thing I need. I lined the inside of a cabinet, fastened a dummy door pull to the closet, and added a 3/4 inch piece of wood to the bottom of a door in less than ten minutes. Very fast and very strong!
  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO.",TRUE

"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously.

He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind.",TRUE

Jase knows who ""Sammi"" is now. How did he find out ? Will he tell Dornan? Is he truly still the boy that Juliette loved, still loves? Is he on her side?

It was like I was holding my breath with Juliette waiting for Jase to figure it out. Then he does and I felt relief and then much like Juliette I felt despair at the consequences now that Jase knows. What a roller coaster ride of emotions!

Mira Grant is an excellent world builder. Adding more details to the story of how the Kellis-Amberlee virus was created and spread only made the possibility that something like that could really happen seem even more believable to me.

"When I heard there was going to be a Jurassic Park III, I thought it would suck. The ending to ""The Lost World"" was a great way to end the series. So I figured it would suck and give Jurassic Park a bad name. I was wrong. This one had the most action and was the most intense one in the series. I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts. For one example, the ending when the army and Navy showed up to rescue them. It was to unrelistic. The movie is still great though.

"This bicycle light mounted relatively easily to the handle bars of  my 20"" folding bike, but you do have to unscrew it totally to get it on.  The on/off button is easy to reach when riding.

I also was happy that the batteries were already installed when I took it out of the box, especially since it came with no instructions.  This light is bright enough for  me to be seen in the early evening.  I haven't used it at night yet but have tested it in a dark house and it is very bright.
The only little complaint is that you do have to totally unscrew the mount to take it off of the bike, and the little metal cylinder kept falling onto the ground.  Since I don't plan to take it off, I am thinking of adding a cable tie to make it more secure from theft.",TRUE

"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

"Loved it!!!

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's.

I picked it up because I thought it was some sort of crime novel and then it turned out to be about people - not my usual bag at all.

"This is the dictionary of bellydance- 2 discs- she goes through standing moves, traveling moves, veil and zill introductions, and some combinations.  Very useful and it is voiced over- she doesn't stop moving, the narration explains what she is doing.  I like how she doesn't dissect things to the point where you can't foresee what you trying to do.  She does the movements up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns.  Beautiful variety of costumes, Jehan illustrates that you don't have to have a model's figure to be a gorgeous sexy dancer- she is so beautiful!

I recomend that you also get 'the ultimate bellydance workout' with this dvd set because that dvd is fantastic and this set explains what the dancers in the other dvd are doing.  If you have the other and were discouraged because you couldn't quite get how they were doing certain moves, this dvd set explains it all.",TRUE

"First off, this kit's only intended for the 1st year class.  There is a tiny one-piece set that the kid can put together and then put back together.  In other words, it is a simple set of stairs, a one-piece set that is easy to assemble, and a 2-piece set that is very difficult.  So it is a little challenging for older kids to put together, but it is pretty easy for younger kids to put together.  The kit comes with a few parts that the kids can use, but they don't actually put them together.  So it's a little more challenging for older kids to put together.  It is also a little harder for younger kids to put together.  It is also a little more challenging for younger kids to put together.  The pieces are very small, so it is a little harder for them to put together.  Overall, this is a very educational set that is a good value for a 5-year-old.

"Who wouldn't love this patriotic little toy, the only thing I didn't like is the tiny one.

I had to get a replacement. The box was a mess. I sent it back and it still looks like it's broken. I wish it was a little bigger. The box is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. I wish it had a little more space. I just wish there was a little more space for the sound effects. It's very small. Overall it's a great little toy, but I would buy it again for my grandchildren.

I'm glad I found this seller, because I was disappointed in the quality. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was a huge fan. It is a great toy for an 8 year old. My son is a little older then I thought, but he loves to play with it. I don't recommend this toy to anyone but my grandchild.

My son loves this toy. My son is 4 and has had it for about a month now and it's been a hit! He's played with it more than any other toy I've purchased. He's also been able to play with it all the time and it's been great! I think it's perfect for little hands! I like that it comes with a small zipper that makes it easier for him to take it out of the bag and out of the bag. The zipper is sturdy and a great size for a 2 year old.

"FINALLY! I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for The Alpha King, but I know I've worked my way through a few versions of the Kindle since I first read The First Alpha!

I fell deeply in love with this series way back in 2013, and since then I've checked back every week for news on the sequel. Now it's here I know it was worth the wait! I fell in love with Thomas Smith from the first page, but when I realised who he was - and how he works into the world of the Five Tribes - I fell in love all over again. I don't want to give away the twist, but if you've read The First Alpha you'll be blown away when you... well, you'll know it when you see it :)

As for the romantic element, LOVE IT! I love a ballsy, take no prisoners heroine, and I love how Evelyn deals with the men she encounters in this male-dominated world of 1912. She's more than a match for 'Thomas' (or should I call him... no, no spoilers), and I can't wait to see how they deal with the Ironclaws now they're a team.

"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish.",TRUE
"If you are a reader who enjoys the challenge of a time sequence that is replete with starts and stops you will enjoy this novel. Set in pre- WWI England, the main character, Ursula, repeatedly dies and then is reborn into a new life.  Everything she did previously is lived again with the exception of the events that led to her death in the previous life, which she has, upon rebirth, mysteriously learned to avoid.  However easy it is, or not, to follow the plot line, the often sporadic insertion of monologue and dialogue that is foreign to the action, makes the text confusing to the point of unnecessary exhaustion.  There is nothing more to recommend the text; by way of attractive characters, interesting events or intriguing action, that might cause the reader to make the effort to decipher it.  From the initial pages you know that Ursula is destined to make an attempt on Adolf Hitler's life.  You might think that tumbling through time and the text would make it worth the trouble.

My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with.

"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.",TRUE
"Not bad for the price.
The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad.",TRUE

"This historical thriller revolves around the Earl of Walden and his family, who all become involved in a life and death struggle the outcome of which could have a serious influence on World War 1.

Walden receives a visit from Churchill, asking for help negotiating with Russia about alliances in the forthcoming War.  Walden feels this is an exciting opportunity to further his career, whilst his Russian wife finds it brings back unwanted memories of a love she has tried to put behind her.  Meanwhile their daughter is busy thinking about being presented to the King and Queen and her first Season  whilst beginning to discover that the real world is not quite as her sheltered upbringing has led her to believe.

Alongside the family activities in London and at their country estate,  the suffragettes are fighting for womens rights, a Russia anarchist has arrived to assassinate the Russian delegate Walden is negotiating with, and interesting discussions are being held on the moving of European boundaries to satisfy political needs.

"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked.

"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that was Allegiant, which was in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book was available for free at my library and the other books I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short stories is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the stories themselves, knowing the truth behind everything as revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I was forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these stories for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the stories were just okay. While we do learn some new details about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which covers a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it was just. okay. Altogether the collection was a three-star read. There was nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library. (Oh, and if you're going to buy it in e-book format, buy them separately. Amazon seems to be taking advantage of the fact that some people may not be observant/bright enough to notice that it's actually more expensive when you buy the bundle than if you just bought them for $1. 99 each.",TRUE

"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price.",TRUE

"First and foremost they claim this is an BBW romance. The author never mentuons that in the book but they do talk about all the time in the gym she spends and how proud she is of her body and her beauty. How he touches her taut abs and toned legs and so on. Yes you can be curvy and fit but I didn't get that from this book. I feel like she is a skinny gym rat. The book itself starts out so boring I  had to force myself to keep reading. It picked up a little at the end but the ""twists"" in the story didn't  intrest me and where kind of sick. Only a handful if males can mate and she was kidnapped after concieving from one night. Then she gets passed around to the brother. They expect her to have sex with him, which she does, and have 20 babies. Then with the upheavals all she is is a vessel. When I read a romance I  do not expect the heroine to have to have sex with different people and be treated like a baby making whore. I am begging anyone reading this review to pass on this book.

"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

Still, I don't regret this purchase at all!",TRUE
"Store bought cakes can be expensive.  We found a recipe to make bird seed cakes and adjusted it a bit so the cakes were not so hard.  We call them Bird-Day Cakes!

Use 1 pack of Knox Gelatin and 2 cups of water and 2 rounded cups of Bird Seed. Prepare Gelatin per directions.  You can use 2 packs if you want the seed cake more firm.  They might even last longer, but I can't imagine the birds like it.  This makes 2 mini bundt ""Bird-Day Cakes"".

Mix together and pour/pack into mini bundt cake molds that have been sprayed with your favorite non-stick spray. (Gotta have the hole in the center for this feeder.) Place in refrigerator until set.

We use Shell-less seeds for this.  They are expensive and you can certainly use regular bird seed or whatever your favorite bird loves.  We only use 1 cake at a time and haven't stacked them yet. The birds finish this off in 2-3 days.

We have giant breeds and one lived to 11 and one is now 10.  We have younger babies also. And it supplies all the energy they need.,TRUE
"Everything about this movie captivated me right from the start.  It's sort of slapstick, but i just loved the portrayal of the characters.  The casting was perfect. The story was interesting, the visuals of the little town were enchanting, filmed in Malta, it carried me away to a fairy tale land and a real mental vacation.  I'm an old lady but I found it irresistible.",TRUE
"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice.",TRUE
"So I read the review and thought I would give it a try.

The first book in the series was the prequel, Prequel 2, and I'm a fan. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I love how the author wrote the descriptions of the characters. I liked the fact that they were all over the place. There was also the fact that the author had to use a lot of language. It was like a well written story.

I liked the fact that the author used a lot of words and it made the story more realistic. I think that the author would have used some of the things that could have been used for a different story.

I liked the fact that the author kept the main character's name and family name. I also liked that the author used a lot of slang.

The story was good. I really enjoyed the story.

"I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

I had a 2TB WD Media Writer and it worked great. I had to start up Win7 64 bit to get the MBR to work. The MBR was all I could get out of Win7 64 bit, but I was able to get it to work on my Win7 64 bit machine. I had to restart Win7 64 bit to get it to work. The MBR is a little bit larger than the Win7 64 bit drive, but I can tell that it works fine on my Win7 64 bit machine.

I have no complaints about this drive.

I don't recommend this drive to anyone unless you have a 32 bit drive, and I don't.

I did have to order another Win7 64 bit drive to get the MBR to work, but it was a pain.I purchased this for my new computer.  I use it for gaming and watching movies.  I don't use it for any other purpose.  I don't use it to use the external hard drive.  The drive is small and works well.  The USB connector is very small and doesn't work as well.

"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain.",TRUE

"This board is perfect for quick games as well as teaching beginners. The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance).

The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.

Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!)

Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc.",TRUE

I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feels their business is in a bit of a rut. I can't say you will find direct examples, but if you keep your mind open you'll see the larger points he is making re: business. It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business, including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.

"I guess the biggest criticism I have of this toy, is really my own fault for not reading the description more thoroughly. I assumed this toy would be perfect for my daughter's bathtime, or to play with in the pool.

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is.",TRUE
"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness.",TRUE

It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

"First off, let me just say we spoil our dog.  I'm sure most people do.  For our little Maltese, we've tried a variety of dental chews.  His favorite treats are Greenies.

After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...

We've tried all kinds.

Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.",TRUE

The faucet is designed for 4"" to 18"" spread between the handle and spout, but I do not recall that being specified in the advertisements. Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance. The LED cable is a three conductor cable with a jack and receptacle connection. To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively.

"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!

He spends the first half of the book in a different college town, but then goes to another college.  He goes to college in a different town and his father is a college professor.

I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.

It is a good way to get a sense of the reality of the situation you are in and how you will react to it.

"I realize that it is not an easy task to make a cold steel bat, but I'm not a fan of the idea. The bat is designed to be a little too cold, so it's not ideal for a bat like this. I wish it was a little thicker, but I don't think it's a bad idea. I'd be more inclined to buy a heavier bat. I just wish there was some kind of ""blinking"" on the bat when I got it, and if I got one I'd be happy. I'm happy with it, but I'm a little concerned about it being too soft. I'll be keeping it at my home to get a better grip on it.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very sharp. I was able to cut down",FALSE
"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light.",TRUE

I had to read the book to get through the story. The author does a great job of describing the characters.

"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.",TRUE

"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form.

However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.

Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten.

Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.

Ghost Whisperer is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a strange and bizarre world where the world is very different from the one they grew up in.

"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.",TRUE

"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.

"In 2006, Grigory Perelman proved that an academic with a PhD in history could make a difference in the lives of two people. The book, ""A History of the United States"", is a great book. It covers the history of the United States from the American Revolution to the present day. In the book, Perelman provides us with a list of the major events that shaped the nation. He discusses the role of the American Revolution and the role of the white slave trade in the growth of the country. He also discusses the history of the American Revolution and the role of the slave trade in the development of American capitalism.

"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects.",TRUE

So we have been drinking wine for the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just ordered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can order one of these at a time for one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner.

"Nobody's Fault was very well written and the author uses descriptions and dialogue with expertise and care. The story itself was told well and the loose ends tied together nicely in the end.

When those kids are grown and gone you can find your own freedom and a new life if that's what you need to. But to walk away from your wife, leave your children to live in a single parent home for your own emotional needs? Selfish beyond description. As for the feelings of his new love, the other woman?

"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

"I purchased this product and there was no option in the tools menu to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3.  When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it.  When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

"Veiled by L. Chapman is a story about losing the one you love and finding someone when you least expect it. Jenny is put through more than one could imagine as she begins to feel her pending nuptials are in danger of panning out. Her fianc, Rich, has become withdrawn in their relationship. Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Much to Jenny's surprise, she finds her husband with another man. He is honest with her and explains the possibility of a health risk. The two are not on speaking terms thanks to this shocking revelation. After tests and full disclosure to Warren, they continue to get closer with their feelings. Knowing her whole world is changing right before her eyes, Jenny decides to move on the best she can and let things take their rightful course.

Veiled ends one happy ending and gives hope to finding a new one. The plot moves quickly as it seems a black cloud is following Jenny everywhere she goes. Her share of bad luck surely must be about to end soon. I was happy to see Mark and Megan were still going strong in their relationship. Baby Lucy is cherished and loved by her little family. Unfortunately, it was hinted that there would be upcoming turmoil with Lucy's custody.

"First, the outstanding quality of Joanne Harris' writing is her use of mouth-watering culinary descriptions.
Her plot here is much more involved than in Blackberry Wine, and much darker.  I happen to like the darker in terms of reading (my favorite is C.J. Cherryh's Cyteen; check THAT out), but I do have to say the narrator was hard to sit next to for the length of the book.  Witty and earnest and devious as a child; witty and earnest as a sixty-year-old, but much crankier, and though she retains her spirit, she has lost the deviousness which made her younger self a delight.  Case in point:  When a loud neighbor and competitor moves in, her strategies to combat him are downright ordinary, exactly what youth would expect of the rigid elderly.  Her triumph is the sort of thing I can see my grandmother sitting in her living room telling to her elderly friends, while they nod in agreement.  ""And >I< told HIM...""
Some of the reviews seem appalled that the younger Framboise went to such measures to torment her ""poor"" mother.  Poor nothing!  Framboise fought back in what was an intolerable environment.  By the end of the novel one can see her mother does care about her children (though unable to show it) and has her own problems, but one is still hard-pressed not to root for Framboise and her siblings in the situation.
I do have to agree with one reviewer and say kudos to Paul for sticking around the whole time, though I can't see why he does.  Framboise is fortunate he does.
All in all, a great character sketch of the lesser parts of being human.  And the ending made me want to put down the book and go on in denial, making up my own ending and pretending it was the real one -- but that's good, it means it's powerful.  Sad is more powerful than happy.",TRUE

"Wow, this is one very intense read! I was so blown away by the emotional pull in this book. I have read other books that Alice has co-authored with and have always loved her work. I have to say I think she outdid herself on this one. So many times I didn't know if I wanted to laugh, cry or just slam the book down and run. When you meet Saga she is just skimming by. Shes worried about making rent and having food to eat. Doing her best to hold on to a job that is not enough to get ahead. When she is at her lowest point, so she thinks things went south in a hurry. When there is no other option she takes a job as an escort. This is where she comes to know Jackson Stone. He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for. Saga is strong, but like all women she has a breaking point and Jackson seems to find just the right buttons to push to break her when he feels like she is getting too close. These two draw you in and keep you wanting more. Im looking and hoping for more from these two.",TRUE

Participating in The Panic, a perilous and potentially deadly series of dares, offers a minuscule chance at winning a pool of money large enough to start a new life somewhere else. The very realistic characters are portrayed as flawed and sincere teens. They are rash and narcissistic, but loyal to a fault when it comes to looking out for the ones they love. Each has a different motive for participating, different plans for the money, and the determination of a mother grizzly. None of the teens is likable all the time, but none is despicable, either.

What I like is that it can all be stored away in a labeled plastic bin with a lid (I use a clear medium sized Rubbermaid bin), so nothing gets lost.

The one detractor of this set in my eyes, is that it's a little overpriced. Unfortunately most of the LPS toys tend to be overpriced when first released. I usually wait until they go on sale.",TRUE

LOVE this beam.  Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No assembly required.  VERY sturdy.  My husband who is 6' 4"" and 215 pounds had no problem walking across it.  The beam did not bend.  Obviously, my husband won't be using it daily.

"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because they are very small, but I'd be happy with them if they were small enough.

I'm not sure if the speaker is that bad because it's only about 10"" wide.  The reason I give this 5 stars is because I don't like the way the sound is wired.  I was able to find some cable that worked for the price but I never heard of it.  If I had known that I could just buy a different cable that worked, I'd probably buy a different set of speakers.

UPDATE:  I contacted the seller to see if they would send me a replacement pair of speakers.  They told me that they would not and I was able to order one of these.  I was able to send them a replacement pair of speakers but I still have a problem.

The speakers sound great and I'm happy with the sound.  The only downside is that I don't like the way the bass is wired.",FALSE

This item is definitely not what the average-sized female would consider as a 1-size fit.  I am 5'7"", 36 DDD and have a long torso.  I started not to even bother trying it on because it looks tiny coming out of the package.  Once I had it on, I found that the elastic under the bust area does reach where it needs to and the stretch of the fabric didn't make it feel like it was too small.  It even reached far enough to cover my backside but wasn't long enough to wear into a public place such as a store/coffee shop, etc., after a day at the beach.  The material is soft, slinky, inviting and very comfortable, even despite the fact that I thought it was too small.  The colors are bright, vibrant and cheerful.  Despite the fact that it was too short for my long torso, there is a generous cut to the item which gave a nice flowy feel to it.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell.

"Earth Songs (2012) - (Narrated By Michael York - Actor), (Directed by Brian Luke Seaward - Expert in stress management, mind-body-spirit healing) is the most succinct argument against doing what may have been intended to be an inspirational voice-over in an otherwise visually breathtaking production I've seen recently.  I'm writing this as I'm almost done watching the program on 'mute'.  I frankly couldn't take the insipid palaver.  For about two minutes at the beginning, I was hoping the pap-y-talk would change to something informative or smarm-free.  It didn't.

Here's proof that a fairly accomplished actor with a British inflection can't actually keep up with stunning cinematography when trying too hard to say grammatically correct but meaningless, flowery verbiage.  The attempt to sound poetic is pathetic.  This production is the 'nature' equivalent of the Roman Polansky film Tess (1979) - Gorgeously shot, lifeless, bland, and numbingly tedious.  You find yourself wishing that something would happen.  It doesn't, but Michael York drones on relentlessly anyway.

If you're considering watching this production, let alone buying it, I'd recommend you find something interesting to watch instead.  That way you won't miss the good parts due to having your head snap back, swallowing your tongue, and dying a horrible death from the verbal anesthesia in this production.",TRUE

"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon).",TRUE

"""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is the last of Coelho's trilogy that explores the parameters of Good and Evil and their impact on the human soul.  In this story a stranger, battered and disheartened by the absolute worse that life can dish out, visits a small town with the intentions of carrying out an experiment aimed at assuaging some of his bitterness and pain.  While in the village, he enlists the help of Miss Prym who, bored with small town living, sees an opportunity for escape; but at what cost?  As the story unfolds the people of Viscos learn of the experiment and how they, collectively and individually, can benefit from it.  It is Coelho's interrogation of the villagers' intentions that provides the reader with a glimpse of the dueling forces of good and evil.

The novel is very well translated as I never felt that something was missing while reading it.  The language is loaded with meaning and highly symbolic.  ""Viscos is just like any other village in the world and whatever happens there happens in every continent, city, camp, convent, wherever.""  This is the wisdom shared with Miss Prym by Berta, the village's aged sage who spends her days watching over the village in an effort to see any evil coming.  I've always enjoyed Coelho's work and ""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is no different.  This is a solid story that's easily read and internalized.  Ultimately, what we learn about good and evil from this text sounds a lot simpler than I expected and much more easily articulated than done.  This is a quick yet profound read.  Highly Recommended.",TRUE

"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.

Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)

The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.

The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.

Go back and read the first three or four in the series, especially before Qwill moved to Pickax. They were certainly light reading, but the plots were intriguing, the writing was tighter and the books then deserved their Best Seller status.",TRUE

"seSo I've owned this about a month. I was so impressed by the specs when placed next to the cost it was an easy win. I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt. I have done all I can do to calibrate but nothing really helps.

"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product.",TRUE
"Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing ""Devil's Dream"" fairly to Bell's ""All Souls Rising"", a novel I find the richer and more moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars.

""Devil's..."" is all in all a very entertaining, original and informative read. The story of Nathan Bedford Forrest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tools Bell uses (i.e. the bits of ""magical realism"") add to that fascination . Some of the events in the first half of the novel regarding Forrest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affairs Forrest had are described in a interesting, non-moralistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating..

But in the end, the constant chronological swings tired me. After loving the first 250 pages of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense was that what was described in those last pages had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another horse shot dead from under Forrest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher Forrest's tennessee accent.

I remain an admirer of Smartt Bell. But ""All Souls Rising"" will provide readers a better experience of his talent",TRUE

"UPDATE May 20th ... Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today was the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof.

I finagled the strap to attach on both sides via the metal attachments holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stays out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good.

The bag is much larger than I figured it was going to be.  It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'.

The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually works and when you unfasten it it makes that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it.  Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick.

Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartments and the main compartment.

In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff has it's setbacks too though.

For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one.

I can't say the mystery enthralled me, I figured the second biggest mystery about half-way through the book.  The ""whodunnit"" part was weak, but this book is worth reading purely for the philosophy of the Triumphantes.

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

"The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys

"This a brilliant, fun, thought provoking, wonderful book by a mistress of her craft.  I do not know if it is the best detective novel of all time, but it is up there. I would say it was one of the best novels I ever read - period. I read it many years ago, decades, in fact. I could do no more than give a general synopsis, though usually I don't bother when others have anyway. But, if you put a copy in my hand today, I would read it again. The fact that she was not aware of certain evidence or relied on evidence that we would now perhaps think not so persuasive is irrelevant. Most detective novels are far more unrealistic than this one, which is at least steeped in history. I read some of the negative comments, as I almost always do when I loved a book. Generally speaking, it gives the impression that some people who are uninterested or uninformed by history were bored by the book. But, note that over 80% of reviewers gave it 4 or more stars and over 90% 3 or more. That's pretty good. This is not a Reacher novel (and I like them) and the protagonist is bedridden, so don't expect action. It is a mental adventure and she succeeded wildly.",TRUE

"The Lego Connoisseur Here, Reviewing the Snowspeeder.

True to my beliefs, we picked this up for $25.00 at Legoland.  Less than $0.10 a brick!

Believe it or not, we bought this for a three year old, hey it was Legoland and we were in the moment!  Probably should of known better all things considered...This Lego set feels very strong when built--durable even, through many battle simulations it has survived harsh environments and many gun shots!  Until his other brother shot it down with a fanfare of no other.  Not recommended for little kids since most battles end with a request for a rebuild, much to parents dismay.  However the largest one (ahem...) loves this Lego Star Wars Set.

First, it is a relatively older set.  I remember it when I was boy.  My friend had it (and all the other ones too).  Tons of fun, decent instructions to go along with it, but not quite as user friendly as the newer more, ""step by step"" instruction designs.  This felt more true to the old movie than many other sets without as many custom parts as those tend to have.  Plus Luke, with a light-saber is always awesome.

The few complaints I have is related to the cockpit...There really isn't enough room.  I wish they had built it up a little more so that the fighters could sit up straight.  I also which that Luke had some spot to put his light-saber in the cockpit.  I think the spring-shooting darts are a bit too sensitive, they went off several times without much input from me.  And finally, the little shooter by the grappling hook can easily fall out and it isn't exactly the easiest piece to put back on.",TRUE

Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.

"The Darling is a magnificent book, far ranging and very compelling. Russell Banks, like Wally Lamb, writes authentically in the voice of a woman, so much so that it is hard to believe this book was really written by a man.

The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carrington, the darling of the title. What a misnomer! She is anything but darling. Selfish, self-absorbed and admittedly lacking any maternal instinct whatsoever, Hannah is not a sympathetic character, in spite of all she endures, nor even a very likeable one.

This is a story of a political radical's flight to W. Africa and her subsequent marriage to a black Liberian, which results in the births of three children. It is, of course, a tale of politics, race relations, and terrorism. But it is also a story of one woman's efforts to learn about herself and to make a life of value. Whether she ever succeeds at this goal is debatable.

"Daisy's friend, Chloe, invited her to her book launch party. Since Chloe's book is based on Daisy of course she goes to the party. Too bad the party was a bust. There weren't many people attending but the ones that did go sure made it a memorable night.

Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses!

"This is a great coloring case.  It has a crayon set, a colored pencil set, and two sets of markers - pip squeak sized small markers and regular size.  As other reviews have noted, it costs about the same as it would to buy all the included crayons, pencils, and markers separately at full price.  The separates will go on sale, and so will this case.

Crayola is good quality.  The products are not light fast, so over time, pics left in windows or bright light will fade.  Colors are bright and markers last longer than dollar store products.  Crayons are the best, since many other brands are waxy and weak.  This set has washable markers, but not the washable crayons or pencils.  So, needs supervision for small children who might write on the wall.  Crayons are made in the US; pencils made in Brazil; case and markers made in Vietnam.

The carrying case has plastic shells glued to the inside that hold the crayons, pencils, and markers.  It looks all neat and tidy, and the latches hold it closed fine for carrying around.  I have not yet lost markers, but since I got this to share with a two year old, some marker tips have been damaged.  Sets drive me nuts when I start missing pieces, but that's the nature of sets.

"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",TRUE

Putting on these socks made my feet very happy! Right when I took them out of the package I could feel how soft and well made they were and when I put them on my feet that was immediately confirmed. They are extremely comfortable and the fit is perfect. I always prefer to buy quality socks that come in different sizes. I have somewhat small feet (8 1/2 mens) and those one size fits all socks you get in department stores never fit me right. The heels always seem to ride up the back of my ankle which is very annoying. With these socks the size medium fits and hugs my feet perfectly and the fabric feels great against my skin.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage.

"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.",TRUE

There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds.",TRUE

"All in all, it's a decent blade, gets the job done - cuts aluminum. It came nicely packaged in thick cardboard ""sleeve"", with clear tubing protecting the teeth. 5 stars for packaging.
At my place, it will be used now and then for thin aluminum angle and strips.
Cuts are not clean, I have to use a file to clean them up and smooth the edges. Were I a professional, this would have been unacceptable, but since I am not, I can live with it (for a while, till perfectionism gets the best of me).
In the past I've used one much more expensive aluminum-cutting blade. We're talking close to $100, and smaller diameter (between 7"" and 8"" -can't remember exactly). Now, THAT blade... The resulting cuts were immaculate, smooth-edged and shiny (not dull and ""barbed"" as with the blade being reviewed), and did not require any further finishing work.

If you're a hobbyist like me, needing to make a dozen cuts once in a blue moon, then save your money and get it.
If you're a professional, invest into something of better quality.",TRUE

"Laurel Hawthorne is a woman with secrets, which she believed she'd left behind when she married David and moved into a posh gated community. Until, that is, the night that their daughter's friend drowned in the Hawthornes' pool, a terrible event that put a huge crack in Laurel's carefully maintained facade. The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a riveting, Southern gothic, family drama, driven by the skeletons in Laurel's closet, her fear for her own daughter, and her love-hate relationship with her glamorous older sister, Thalia. Did someone cause Mollie's drowning? Was it an accident or a murder? What does daughter Shelby know that she isn't telling? Does David have a mistress? Do ghosts really appear to Laurel? And, underlying all these foreboding questions is an even darker one, about a death that occurred during her childhood.

The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a real page turner, from the first to the final chapters.",TRUE

"This doll house is extremely sturdy! All of the walls are nearly 1/4"" thick wood (or pseudo-wood composite) product. Some other reviews stated that the assembly instructions were very vague and difficult to read and that the product was difficult to assemble.

All of the parts lined up perfectly (a few other reviews said they didn't, so I'm thinking the ones that didn't weren't assembled correctly).
The furniture that came with the dollhouse is also very sturdy and well-crafted. The lamp (which lights up) has a timer on it which helps with battery life. The house itself stands nearly four feet tall - it's really big! Compared to the flimsy plastic and cardboard Barbie doll houses for close to the same price (been there, done that, lasted a month before it was destroyed by light play!), this dollhouse is a hundred times sturdier and just plain superior.

"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading.",TRUE

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",TRUE

"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness.

I like how I can wear these with my office outfits as well as with casual clothes as they are both stylish and fashionable. I can dress them up or down and still look fabulous. Overall, I am content with this purchase as they are cozy, comfy and sexy!

"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power.
A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel.",TRUE

"This standalone conclusion to the Norseton Wolves series is one of my favorites. Holley Trent has a gift of getting inside her character's heads and succinctly communicating their emotions, fears, hopes and desires to the reader. I don't know of any other author who can lay a character open with such understanding and yet do it with humor and compassion.  She is one of my top five authors, in part for that reason. I highly recommend this book and the series, which can standalone individually, as well as from it's companion Afotama Legacy series.

Arnold has only been in Norseton a few days when he has a vision that takes him to the Roosevelt Forest in Colorado. He has seen a she wolf and her baby and all he knows about them is that the goddess wants him there to meet them. When he arrives, he sees the woman shift into her wolf form, leaving the infant unprotected.
Leonora was recently bitten by her mate and is forced to shift with the full moon, requiring her to leave Kinzey alone in the forest. She's on the run from a culture that denigrates women and an abusive relationship where she is seen as a possession rather than a person. She made her decision to run and having no support system is a consequence of that choice. But she has very strong protective instincts for her daughter and when she returns to her human form to find a strange alpha male wolf shifter cuddling an unusually calm Kinzey, she's enraged. He refuses to hand Kinzey over, though, and she soon finds they are headed to Arizona, to a pack he says is different. How can she believe him, when what he says goes against everything she's ever experienced?  Especially when he bites her while they are in wolf form and neither of them remember anything from that run. He promised her she would have choices at Norseton. But  the first thing he did was to take them away.

First off, I need to make sure I get the correct size so I can fit the gun in the right position. This is a very large gun, so it's not really a problem. If you are going to use it as a full sized gun, it's a good idea to get a larger size. If you are going to use it for a kid, it's a good idea to get a larger size.

Secondly, if you have a kid who is going to be a little bit older, you need to be careful not to break it off. If you have a kid who is going to be a little bit younger, you may want to take the gun apart. This can be difficult for them to handle, but it's a good idea to put the gun back in the right place.

Thirdly, I need to get the correct size for the gun. I've had some issues with the paint being a bit on the gun and the gun's head not coming off. I'll update this post if I find a better solution.

"To being with, it's very important that we pay attention to the exact subtitle of this book-this is ""vampiric"" erotica, not ""vampire"" erotica.  While all of the stories revolve in some way around parasitic characters, only a few of them are the classic warm-thick-blood-sex vampire erotica.  Most of the stories are at least creepy, and a few are quite scary.

As wth any collection of short stories, not every story will be to every person's taste, as you can see from the reviews here.  In particular, the story ""The Dripping of Sundered Wineskins"" seems to elicit a love-it-or-hate-it opinion.  Personally I loved it.  I enjoyed all of the straight vampire tales, especially, of course, Neil Gaiman's excellent opening tale, ""Snow, Glass, Apples"".  Other notable vampire stories were ""Ceilings and Sky"", Whispers in Walled Tombs"", ""First Date"", and ""Bloodlight.""

Unfortunately, though, there are several stories I hated, too.  ""Armies of the Heart"" was one, and I really, really hated ""When Memory Fails"" and ""The Fly Room.""  Eyeball-sucking?  Little mouths hanging around where they shouldn't be? Yeuch, no thank you!  And ""Bela's Plot"" I unfortunately just did not understand.  Were there actual vampires, or just sadists?

"Going Against Type by Sharon Black (click here for Author Wednesday guest post) went toward my type of delightful light-hearted contemporary romance set in Dublin, Ireland. The genre hearkens back to the 1950s with mismatched lovers such as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, albeit with Irish eyes and tastes.

Charlotte ""Charlie"" Regan yearns to find her place in a world dominated by men as a sports' reporter and columnist. The hero of the story also fights for his place in the world of fashion writing where men are in short supply. It doesn't help matters that they work for harshly competitive newspapers and somehow find themselves pitted against one another when Charlie steps into the world of fashion by criticizing the footballers of Ireland for advertising popular name brands.

The novel reverberates with authenticity of the life of a journalist always under pressure to be fast, accurate, and edgy. Ms. Black, herself a journalist, paints a realistic picture of both Charlie and Derry despite their opposite views. I liked the twist in the story that turned stereotypes on end. It reminded me a bit of the movie with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, You've Got Mail. For most of the novel, neither Charlie nor Derry know the other one is the author behind the viperous attacks in the two rival columns written anonymously. In the meantime, they begin dating, enjoying their time together more each time.

If you want to escape for a few hours into the world of Irish football, fashion, and foibles, you won't be disappointed with Going Against Type. I think it's the first Irish novel I've read that wasn't historical, which makes it both refreshing and light.",TRUE

"Judging by the Cover. By Dawn Doyle  4 Stars
The say blood is thicker than water, and family comes before anything. I found out real quick that blood is not thicker than Money. Everything I thought I knew had turned upside down in the blink of an eye. Demi who escapes after witnessing several family members being murdered. She is placed into protective custody  and moved across country. Demi has to keep herself hidden, not recognisable while out and about. So she dresses in goth clothes and dyes her hair. Jordan the guy that lives next door is furious that someone has moved into his best friends house. Demi and Jordan's first meeting did not go well at all. He knows he is being irrational about this but he is too hurt to care about anything but  his own feelings. Even with time they still cannot stand each other. But Jordan senses that there's something different about the goth looking girl. As their friendship develops secrets come to light and they understand each other better. They must prepare to protect themselves to survive. This was a very exciting book with lots of sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nail moments. The banter between Demi and Jordan was hilarious as much as heart warming. Can these two find love before the bad guys find Demi. The author did a great job with the story and  keeps you guessing throughout the book.",TRUE

"Ceony thought that the danger was over. She saved the magician she was apprenticing and put an end to the threat. She didn't expect to be targeted for revenge for what she did. She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first.",TRUE
"This kit solved my problem of wireless doorbell range issues where you cannot place those wireless kit doorbell buttons outside on your metal framed front door.  Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.  Since the wireless transmitter is now inside your house, you get much better transmit range and you can place your remote wireless doorbell much further away upstairs and it will still be triggered.  So this is a good useful solution kit to get.",TRUE
"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The cord was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months.",TRUE

"Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born.  We were a little worried about putting toys in his crib, but soon got over that when we realized how well he reacted to Pooh and the music!  Yes, it is a little loud for a lullaby toy, but the volume has never seemed to bother him -- he sleeps right through it.  When he was still in the infant stage, we used the remote control constantly to restart Pooh from the comfort of our bed if our son hadn't fallen asleep yet.  It's great that the remote allows you to select your starting point: the toy comes with three ""stages"" of songs, moving from singing to just music to soft music and bird chirps.  We would replay the softest music when the baby was nearly asleep, the singing when he was still fussy and needed more distraction.  He is one year old now, and he has learned over time to turn it on and off (push the cloud on the pillow).  We know he's awake when Pooh starts singing!  Quite often he hasn't quite had enough sleep, and he turns Pooh on, curls up with his blanket, and goes back to sleep.  The little light under the cloud is a great bonus, since it gives the baby a little ""comfort light"" when Pooh starts to sing (the light fades out as the music softens).  Our son LOVES this toy -- we couldn't imagine bedtime without it!  ONLY drawback (and it's negligible)--he loves it SO much that we really go through the AA batteries!  All things considered, that's a pretty good ""problem"" to have.  We highly recommend this toy.",TRUE

"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.

The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.

The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.

Jamie is a special type of witches breed and her power is coveted by more dangerous, powerful beings who kill anyone who gets in their way.

Aiden was raised by a horrid man who sexually abused him. Finally able to get away, he doesn't consider himself worthy of any woman, especially a human one. Yet, he will go to any lengths to protect Olivia, even die for her if he has to. Hot on their heels are the bad demons and undeadlies. Can Aiden and his fellow Watchmen stop them from capturing or hurting Olivia and Jamie? Will Aiden be able to hide his tiger-shifter powers from being exposed to Olivia and thus, frightening her? Or does the thought of unleashing the cat underneath his skin make her purr?

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd. For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end. A major bonus point for the author providing a list of glossary of terms so as to not confuse the reader, especially since if, like me, this is your first foray into the Watchmen series. It made it easy to catch up to speed. A fascinating tale, be sure to consider picking up a copy of Touch of Seduction",TRUE

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't.

Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my experience is that the Tidy Cat clumping litter has more dust then the Tidy Cat lightweight litter, and tracks less.  My cats don't show a preference from one over the other, but lugging around 35 lb buckets is making me make a preference.  This lightweight litter actually seems to clump harder.  And when you have to scoop through 3-4"" of litter to remove the clumps, the lightweight litter makes a big difference.  In the past, I have kept 200-300 pounds of litter on hand, now I can have half that weight on hand, which is easier on me.  And yes, litter tracks.  I don't care what type you get, they will manage to track it.  I don't smell urine odor, but feces odor depends on whether the cat decides to bury it or not, or how well.",TRUE

There is enough strength to cut through framing nails (.131"" or thereabouts) with little difficulty; wood screws cut like butter.  Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.

The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade.",TRUE

"I'm a 6'2 240 pound amateur bodybuilder. I ordered this for an alternative cardio method living here in South Florida and as a fishing platform. To be clear I use this solo as the single seater was too small and I exceed the weight limit.

First impressions it's not exactly portable long distances. It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.

It actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.

The perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.

Only complaint is I wish it had a collapsible fiberglass rod or 2 like a tent to give some stability to the hull.",TRUE

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or fantasy/thriller/adventure. I really enjoyed this book. I read it to a friend, and I enjoyed it very much.

"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

"This card works great and installs easily.  I am a little disappointed in the lack of software to support its functionality.

  I bought this card to be used in a Ubuntu server where I run Plex to serve my house TVs.  Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to install any drivers.  It just plain works.

  What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).

"4.5 stars

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

"This is an exact OEM replacement for my 24V/80lb iPilot Riptide ST, and presumably other similar models.  This is a great unit and meets my every expectation.

Linking is snap.  Hit the learn button on the head of the iPilot and hit any button on the remote.  You will get a confirmation beep.  That's it.

This stays on as long as your iPilot is on.  As the remote battery ages, the remote will go to sleep on you.  This is normal. I have never experienced any other disconnection or difficulty with linking with the original remote or this replacement.  When the remote goes to sleep, the trolling motor keeps doing whatever it was doing.

If you are having trouble linking remote or are losing connection (other than the sleep mode to save battery on the remote), it is more likely that your iPilot unit is going bad.  Keep that in mind before you throw this product under the bus.  These remotes are solid as a rock.

I recommend having at least two methods to control your trolling motor.  This remote plus the foot pedal, or two of these remotes, or one of these remote and one mini remote, etc.  Also, having a couple extra batteries on board is a good idea.  The batteries last me about 10-12 months with moderate use, and replacements can store unused for 3 years or more.  You do get some warning that the battery is dying, but not super accurate.

This does not include the fancy Minn Kota lanyard.  The product description does not say that it is included.  Minn Kota website does not say it is included.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this product brings the lanyard.  To be clear, this product does not bring the lanyard.  It is the remote unit with the battery installed.

"Ordered these from Amazon but there was problem with 1-day shipping. Ended up getting them from Peter Glenn, as I needed them in time for a trip. But after experiencing them, I just had to come leave a review. I mostly wear Merino Wool dress socks, as my wardrobe is primarily comprised of suits. However, when I do wear sneakers, I solely wear Viscose socks made from Bamboo, which has a softness similar to or surpassing cashmere socks (depending on the brand), and have become quite spoiled by them. I was looking for a nice pair of Bamboo no-show socks, and I encountered this brand on Amazon. Eye-brow raised, because it had the best of both worlds in the composition (Merino Wool + Bamboo). So I ordered the Ultra-light version, and was surprisingly disappointed because that version was abrasive / scratchy; not soft at all. But there were so many great reviews on these socks, and I noticed there was a thicker version (Ultra-Light versus Light Cushion), so I decided to experiment and give them a try as I thought the thicker version might be softer. Well, I'm glad that I did, because these socks feel great. The feel is very comparable to Cariloha bamboo socks, which is the best pure bamboo viscose brand I've encountered and I've tried tonnes of brands. I'm glad that I tried this brand as Cariloha socks although there is a low cut version, they are not compression socks. Feetures! has the cashmere range level of softness, with the compressive benefits making it the all around best sports sock I've tried. I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that, first the socks are not truly ""no-show"" socks. It's very easy to see the socks, but I like that it doesn't cover my ankles. The other thing is the branding. I would've prefered more subtle branding, perhaps only a symbol / logo, but that's a personal style thing. It does not inhibit nor take away from the experience of the sock.",TRUE

"Chuck Palahniuk is most known as the author of Fight Club, the book that became the movie with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; and overnight Palahniuk had a cult following. Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.

This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.

From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores. This book will at times, turn your stomach, but will give you an understanding of the darkest side of human nature.

Readers beware! This book is like the fight club movie on super steroids.

M. Flanagan has an amazing story line. I loved her characters, the way they came together and the way the reader got to know them.

"If you love strategy games, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the U.S. versus Russia during the Cold War and you can feel the tension as each side tries to control countries around the world. You get to live through most of the major events of that time period because they are actually played out in the game.

I'm not sure the word ""fun"" would best describe this game - you are certainly not laughing your way to victory with a wacky group of friends. But if your idea of ""fun"" is deep strategy, constant awareness of how each new event changes the world's politics- and therefore your alliance and chance of winning, and tough decision making, then you will LOVE this game!
I would say the learning curve is moderate as there are a lot of things to keep track of, but once you get a few plays in, things are smooth sailing.

"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).

"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.

Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.

Would recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!",TRUE

"We have 4 cats. They all seem to love this litter. They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it was because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter boxes downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cats used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter was used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box was use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clumps in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the positions of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) was used all day. The clay litter box was clean! Both upstairs clay litter boxes were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cats standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box was being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY.

"Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.",TRUE

"Play-doh equipment has always looked super fun on the shelf at the store.  However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

Things that could be improved, ideally there would be a way or a tool to make the correct shaped log, or a way to just stuff play-doh in and it still work without jamming up.",TRUE

"Hello Darkness has a convoluted story line that's forgettable about five minutes after you've finished reading it.  The story's main character, Paris, is the host of a late night radio show.  Besides playing music, she also gives her callers advice.  When a caller asks advice about her love life, Paris tells her to drop her loser boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Paris's normal callers.  This turns out to be bad advice, as the dumped boyfriend decides to abduct her.  This is the start of an incoherent story involving an old flame of Paris, whose son is involved with a sex club website that the abducted girl's father runs.  Yes, it's about as silly as I described.  The book is not well written, not remotely memorable.  I would recommend passing on this novel.

"After a good charge, I noticed a noticeable difference in the pressure of the bat. I ran the bat twice a day and it hit a solid 32 FPS, and the bat was very stable.

The bat is a good value, and it's going to last a long time. I haven't used it with a single bat, but I'll try it with a single bat once. I just can't imagine using it with a single bat, because it will feel very weak.

There are some amusing moments - and one sight gag (a la Keystone Cops) that is overused. For me, the intrigue of this movie was less about Ralphie (the main character) and more about the eccentric father and how diametrically opposed the mother was. How in the heck did THESE two hook up?

"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.",TRUE

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comfortable travel pillows Ive ever used.

WHAT IT IS:

- A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck for support with the optional benefit of heat.

WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:

- Memory foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The memory-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comfort and support. Extremely comfortable/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds more support.

- There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit for those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.

I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when working at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The memory foam and plush cover make this pillow comfortable to use for longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need for heat.  Heat or no heat, the THERMATECK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is wonderful.",TRUE

"This book had captured my attention as I had read one of her books from her series Love's Great Adventure and what appealed most was that this book was to be set in New Zealand and since I am from New Zealand, I enjoy books set here. The book starts over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She moves to Auckland where she has an IT job and moves next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book goes along we read as Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the language as being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do things here and our language. The author used phrases like Kia Ora as hello since the character next door was Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writers to grasp the different cultural differences and language. Overall though it was only tiny things that unless you are from New Zealand, you wouldn't notice or pick up.  Honestly, if you are on the lookout for a lovely second chance at happiness and romance story then By My Side is the book for you.",TRUE

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.

"The Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock D1000 is sleek, compact, and works very well.  Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on your desk.

The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.

The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.  The great thing about these USB docks versus the old school docks are that you can really place them anywhere and just hook it up to your computer with a USB cable.  This version is a winner.

"This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight.

"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the

The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking. This child seemed like a half wild animal running through the swamp, screaming and shouting, and the filth...I just wanted to bath her, dress her in clean clothes and show her there is something better. Ugh, I really hated it!",TRUE

"This is a super cute 8GB Frog shaped USB flash Drive. Words cannot express how CUTE this thing is!!! It also comes with a little keychain type hook, so you can connect it to your keys or a lanyard.

I decided to purchase a newer canister type filter.  The reason for this is my 54 gallon tank had been shut down for 3 months with only the dried up gravel in it.  So I started it back up in October of 2014 with my Magnum 350.  I decided to test my tank for ph and ammonia levels and found out that the ammonia was 1.0 ppm too high.  Of course I immediately dosed the tank with Ammo Lock.  Other then that the tank was doing well with no fish in it as of yet.  Because of the ammonia I went to my local pet store supplier and purchase the Aqua top CF400UV.  Installed it and within 24 hours the tank started to cloud up.  I made several water changes and cleaned the filter several times over a period of 2 weeks to no avail.  I contacted my local supplier and they replaced it thinking it must have been defective.  Well! The tank never cleared even after another 10 days of water changes and filter changes.  So I thought I would reinstall my Magnum 350.  Within 12 hours my tank was nearly clear.  After 24 hours it was crystal clear.  So I guess I have to say that I either got two defective filters or the Aqua top 400 UV just could not handle my water condition.  I have over 30 years experience with fish and tanks and I am baffled by this.  I found the filter easy to use and to be very quiet.  Just as an FYI for others who are new to this non self priming filter.  You should fill the canister first about 1 from the top and install the cover then fill the in and out inlets.  Hook it up and just press the primmer button twice or more and just turn it on and you are good to go.,TRUE

"My kids love these soft, bright cars.  Each one is a different vehicle in a different color--they are bright appealing and a great little toy.  Pull one back and let it go--and it zooms across the floor easily! Thing is, my kids are older than 2 and so a little past the age for this particular toy.  So it was perfect when my 1 year old nephew came to visit and we could test drive them with him!

Huge success.  The lightweight, plush design makes them easy for him to grab and hold onto.  He hasn't quite got the zooming thing down yet, but I'm sure he'll get the idea soon enough with my children's avid assistance.  My nephew is drooling quite a lot now (teething) so the cars inevitably got coated in drool and later on in banana.  That's when the particular cleverness of these really became apparent.  The plush tops can be unlatched from the wheel base (just undo the velcro) and washed off without the worry of getting the car mechanism wet.  And while these are certainly an appropriate toy for a one year old, I wouldn't likely leave him with the cars without supervision (just in case a wheel could be pried off), but we can take the car base off and let him play with the plush tops all on their own!

A great toy, and a great gift.  For parents and gift-giving friends who want a toy that's fun but doesn't require batteries and won't send everyone crazy with repeating sounds and lights--this might be just what you're looking for!

Happy playing! ^_^ Shanshad",TRUE

"I really like this product.  My 9lb pomeranians fit compactly within.  It looks a bit snug for them to sit up but it's workable.  The product is very versatile and we've already used them a few times.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.

This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).

I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own.""

Cleaning the litter box will never be a pleasant experience (until my cat starts pooping gold nuggets!), but Litter Genie makes the process neat and easy. I simply use the provided scoop, pick the box clean, and ""flush"" the collection down into the collection bag. No problems and no odor! I am very sensitive to litter box odor, and there has been none since I got my Litter Genie.
Replacing the bags is a breeze, too. Inside the compartment is a cutter--simply pull the bag down from the refill so there is enough to tie a knot in the top of the filled bag. Remove the filled bag. Then, make your new bag by simply tying a firm knot in the cut end of the plastic, forming the bottom of your new bag. Pull down enough material to fill the compartment, close the container, and you're done.

I have one, and occasionally two, cats inside and two litter boxes. Even with two cats, one bag will last me 2-3 weeks. I use natural corncob litter, which is easy to scoop. Very little unused litter gets into my Litter Genie. I don't find it necessary to use a hack for the replacement bags. The refills are reasonably priced since I don't have to change the bag every day (like some reviewers said they were doing). It's easy to carry the Litter Genie between litter boxes because there is a convenient carrying opening on the back, near the top. I have never had trouble with it coming apart while I was carrying it.

I like my Genie so much that I'm going to buy another one, just because I'm lazy and don't want to tote the one I have to the second litter box! I am very, very pleased with my purchase.",TRUE
"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)

Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.

The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made.",TRUE
"First, I compliment Square Jellyfish staff for responsive and rapid response. My unit didn't have the expected battery inside. They more than compensated me for the inconvenience and were both professional and friendly in their dealings with me. Once powered, the unit operated exactly as promised (read the provided documentation!). The Bluetooth signal reach was at 20 feet, more than adequate for my purposes. Various lanyards and rings (like key rings) work well with the remote. Once I settled on a lanyard and memorized the keypad arrangement, it was useful when I had to operate will keeping my eyes and attention focused on a specific task.

"When Callan Carrigans father leaves the ranch to Court McAllister, Callan is shocked to say the least. For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

"First off, I bought the whole package, UltraHD Lighted Work Center, the UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool and the optional 3"" wheels for the bench.

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these.",TRUE

After the intriguing start, it was a long ride for me. There were a few moments when I wanted to jump in the story. Not that I was disappointed.

I liked the characters and I enjoyed the interaction between them. There was also a lot of plot twist and turns. I liked the story. It was an interesting read and I'm glad it ended. I enjoyed the romance between the two main characters. I liked that the main character was a little more mature. I like that the story flowed nicely and kept my interest. I did like that the book was longer than I thought. I loved the story and didn't like the ending. I was a little disappointed that the book ended in a cliffhanger. I wish it had been longer.

"Combing the mythological stories of the Argonauts, with futuristic genetic manipulation, Kneupper has crafted an exciting sci-fi tale that reimagines an old story in a fantastic new way.

 Argonauts is well-written clear, clean prose, strong characterization, and page turning action sequences. It is sure to be a welcome addition to the reading shelf of fans of Sci-fi, and bio-genetics in particular.
 My only criticism of this book is that I would have liked to see Medeas personality be a bit stronger.

Strangely the green engine that comes with this set is the only train that has a problem passing under the bridge. This is out of 15 different train cars by different makers. On a perfectly flat surface its not an issue but on carpet the green engine must be push/pulled through the overpass.

My other issue is the engines don't have magnets on the front. The Thomas and Chuggington engines all have magnets on the front and back. So there are times they get ignored in favor of other trains that don't have to take the lead. However the trailing cars do have magnets on both sides.

But even taking all that into consideration this is a great buy and I'd definitely suggest it as a beginning point for any child interested in trains.",TRUE

"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set.",TRUE

"I purchased this bag in truffle which is a dark grayish color with a bright pink/coral inner liner color,  I wanted a convertible bag family vacations and the safety features made this the perfect bag for that.  Bag is roomy and will hold all the stuff I need to carry around when we are out and about on vacation.  The 2 side pockets and the top pocket all lock the front two pockets do not lock but they are great for non value things that you need to grab quickly.  The locking clips are a little hard to do at first but once you figure them out it's not a problem.
The main reason I selected a convertible bag is I wanted something that is a backpack for being hands free or it can be switched to a crossbody bag for going into a museum or a place that you can't have a backpack.
My only dislike about this bag is the handle strap across the top.  It looks really weird because it sticks out several inches making it look strange when it's on your back & it actually makes it a little unsafe when you have it on since it would be very easy for someone could grab it and pull you over with it.  I took a seam ripper and took it off (you can't cut it because the metal that runs through it to make it slash/cut proof) and I will just use the metal hoops for the strap when I use it as a crossbody bag.  Looks much better without the top strap.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and look forward to using it for many future trips and outings!",TRUE

"Most T.V. viewers already know the Bob Newhart show from the number of times it's been syndicated. If you haven't seen it recently, now is the time to give it another look and see comedy which was driven by good writing rather than by overused and/or hackneyed sitcom plots. It's also a pleasure to see humor which isn't nasty or negative. The Bob Newhart show is downright ""fresh"" when viewed alongside current comedy fare.

As for the complaints about the packaging and lack of extras, one has to consider the *extremely* low price for the season and the experience Fox had with the Mary Tyler Moore show (another classic of the same era). Fox gave the first season of the Mary Tyler Moore show the star treatment and a higher price to cover the cost and it sold poorly. This made them reluctant to even release other classic comedies and the Bob Newhart show may never have seen a DVD release.

While I would have liked to have seen an interview with Bob offering some memories of  his experience with the show (or introductions), I think this type of comedy doesn't benefit much from commentary since the humor is in the pacing and the dialog. Talking over the show would seem rather disruptive and pointless. Also, I'm not sure how much anyone could remember from a show that aired so long ago.

As for the packaging, I like the slim cases and wish all DVDs were released in them. The thicker cases just take up more space on your shelves. Besides, it's what is on the discs that really matters and this show's humor has aged very gracefully. It's a delight to watch again.",TRUE

"I was given an ARC for a honest review. Two words: LOVED IT!

I remember reading Mine to Lose where we were introduced to Trey. After everything that happened, I was hoping that he had his own story. This did not disappoint!

Trey is hurting because the girl he wanted belonged to someone else. He throws all his attention into his work. His younger brother Jett is back and is working with him. He and Trey go to a bar and Trey ends up drinking (which he doesnt do) and spends an amazing night with a stranger. Fast forward later and Trey is trying to get this account for his company, so he has to spend a few days with the owner and basically has to prove why his company is better that the company he previously worked for. That company sends a person to represent them and come to find out, its the girl Trey had that night with, Faith. From there sparks fly and the back and forth between them as they are trying to win the account is so good! They have a love/hate relationship but the attraction is there. talk about hot!

As you get more into the story, we learn more about Faith and who she is. You just want to take the two of them and lock them up so they can get their stuff together, but there are things that prevent it. you will enjoy this story and root for Trey and Faith all the way! Do they get together after everything that's happened? You have to read it to find out. Let me just say that Trey's brother Jett, was hilarious throughout this whole book. I can't wait for him to get his story :)

"I have worn Reebok and Nike over the years and have to say I have been happier with Reebok. In fact the last pair of Nike I got started to come apart in less than a month. These are consistant with what I expect from Reebok. The arch support is average but good in this sneaker. This is a comfortable sneaker that you can wear all day. I really like the 3/4 top a lot. The soles are comfortable give good traction on wet and dry surfaces. I walk 2 miles a day in these and my feet do not hurt.  Reebok's DMX Foam may have something to do with that.

Reebok DMX Foam is a soft and responsive foam compound used to deliver long-lasting cushioning. The focus is to deliver cushioning in the areas players need it most at the ideal time. In the footbed area, DMX Foam is soft and cushioned for high levels of comfort. Meanwhile, closer to the ground, DMX Foam is sturdier and more responsive to provide shock absorption as feet hit the ground.

I think I will be sticking with Reebok in the future because of their consistancy. My Reebok sneakes have lasted me about 9 months on average with everyday wear though. I have gotten as much as a year of wear out of some of them but that was pushing it a bit.  I am going to order another pair of these because I don't want to come back and find out they are not available in a year when I need a new pair.",TRUE

"Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers.",TRUE
"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Does the device itself work? It appears to. Has its support software been well vetted, no.

"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

I look forward to the next book to satisfy my curiosity as well as provide a good read.",TRUE

"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.

"It's been a while since I've finished a book by Ian McEwan feeling more than satisfied, probably not since On Chesil Beach. From 1997-2001  it  seemed he couldn't miss. Then came a few rocky bumps including Solar, which was plain awful and stopped me from reading his books.

The first 20 or so pages of The Children Act promised to be a return to his heights. I was hoping. He has a knack of writing a gripping opening (notably Enduring Love) and then letting it slip a little... there was so much promise in the opening and then it basically deflated towards the end. He does seem to be predisposed to write about the upper middle class and their emotional problems as they drink fine wines and listen to classical music... alongside the freak-show of the lower classes and their predisposition towards stupidity, violence and slyness.

I wonder why I bother while there is a young man, David Mitchell, who is out there with thunder and lightening. McEwan's writing seems a bit dusty and uninteresting in comparison.

"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.",TRUE

"Is this a great novel, or just a great read? That's the question I ask myself before writing this review.  Right now, I can't answer the question.  For me, only time and another read or two will lean me towards one or the other.  I am content now in saying it was a great read,  I really did enjoy it.  Like many, I read through quickly.  The imagery was clear, striking and gripping.  While there was little complex plot to speak of - it didn't need one.  In a world such as that, life becomes simple and difficult, that's how the story was presented.

I question some of the decisions by the father, but he's not meant to be infallible, just human.  His identity and former life are meaningless in such a world, and he is left anonymous, which I truly appreciate.  I can also appreciate the risk the boy took at the end - how difficult would it be to carry on alone?

I can't yet give the book five stars, and wavered between three and four, but it's entirely possible that as the years go by and I pick this one up again, I may appreciate it more.  Given the time it takes to read, it's worthwhile for just about anyone.",TRUE

The widow, Lilith Davenant, never knew affection before, or during her marriage.  That has remained unchanged since her wastrel husband's demise.  She is thought of as one icy, stiff, no nonsense lady of high principles and morals.

A wager has been agreed upon whereby the Marquess of Brandon/Julian must seduce the newly betrothed and aloof Lilith within six weeks.  This in order to remove his cousin, Lord Robert, from the clutches of his conniving mistress and avoid family scandal.  And so the games begin.

"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.

Josie Dorrado's mother Rose begs her for help as the factory where she works has been sabotaged. Frank Zamar, the factory owner, is angry with V.I., and refuses her help as he is obviously terrified of something.

V.I.'s private life is also in turmoil. The man in her life, Morrell, an investigative reporter, is at home recovering from a serious gunshot wound; and Marcena Love, an attractive and gutsy colleague, is staying with him. Marcena is trying to come up with a story on South Chicago and uses V.I.'s work with the basketball team as a way to get to know people. She ends up getting very close to the player's fathers.

The team needs a real coach, a new gym floor and equipment, so V.I. begins to search for corporate sponsors. She meets the grandson of the famous Bill Bysen, the head of a large conservative huge department store chain called By-Smart. Unlike his family, Billy is an idealist that can see how his family's business practices are harming the neighborhood. Billy brings the pastor of the South Chicago church where he is working to preach at the company headquarter's morning prayer meeting. This really antagonizes the family when the preacher lectures them on their responsibility to the poor and the community.

"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.  In short I would say that these are high quality knives, and for the price point, a solid investment.",TRUE

"I greatly enjoyed the Decker/Lazarus early books at the beginning of the series.  They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care about, you almost forgot the books were in the ""Mystery"" genre.  Admittedly, I hadn't read a number of the novels in the middle of the series, but jumped to ""Gun Games"".  Although the elements of the early Decker/Lazarus novels were there, it seemed more ""commercially"" than ""character"" driven.  The ""F"" word abounds and even when it might fit the character and situation; it is over used.  Other graphic sexual terms and situations are also included.  The book seemed a mixed up jumble of young teenaged romance and sex with a mystery thrown in involving more of the same.  That said, the main characters, the foster son of Decker and Rina, 15 year old, Gabe, and his 14 year old girlfriend, are characters you like and hope to see as adults moving on with their lives in a later book.

"Another thoroughly captivating, kept-me-up-reading-all-night story by Josh Lanyon. The story being told in Griff's POV really worked for me, I really connected with him, and reveled in experiencing everything through his eyes, and having access to his impressions of everyone he met. Griff and Pierce made for deliciously intriguing main characters, both having their demons and past hurts to deal with, a past Pierce was so reluctant for Griff to open again..but which he eventually benefited from. The author once again gifts readers with a substantive and poignant portrayal of the human heart.

I loved the distinctiveness of all the secondary characters, each of whom had a crystal clear portrayal.  The Long Island setting and mystique was a character in its own right - I love when an author portrays setting so vividly that I feel as if I am a participant within the story and not simply reading it. The mystery held so many possibilities, just when I thought I was sure of one facet, I found myself doubting... excellent maneuvering of plot, with a great twist at the end. I'll be reading this one again - even though I now know the outcome of the mystery... the lovely nuanced writing style of Mr. Lanyon freely lends itself to new discoveries upon re-reading.",TRUE

"Viperine is daughter of Stheno, gorgon sister of Medusa and Euryale. She is Deuces cousin. She is Beautiful!! Her hair is platinum blonde/ white and is layered over a bunch of snakes that are embedded in her head. Her headband is removable yet it is connected to her head leaving a hole if taken off. She wears a loose fitted dress which exemplifies her hippie boho chic style. On her feet are detailed boots which have little fangs on them. Viperine's body is very reptilian, similar to Jinafires yet also very different. Her accessories include a make-up palette, make-up brush, make-up box, hair brush and diary.

"This is a book that you will want to re-read.  It is complex and ambiguous, so it takes time to ponder over clues and come up with theories as to what exactly happened and what it means.

I will say that the first novella in the book is a very strong, intriguing start.  The second novella describes an alien society.  It is probably a bit perplexing on the first read through, but it is still an entertaining read and you will at least get the overall picture.

I'd recommend this book to any serious science fiction reader, or any serious reader who likes science fiction occasionally.  If you don't like science fiction, you might have a knee jerk reaction to the book just because of its genre.

Annora was sold to an evil Alpha that wanted her for a mate since she was young. Her finding out that she is a bear, born to two wolves, sells her to the evil Alpha as repayment for his debt. But fate steps in and brings her to Parker, who now needs to protect her as only a fated mate can and will.

"This is your typical cheap, made-in-China-esque product. That's fine, but it wasn't .99 - it was what, $6? I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings .",TRUE

She almost looks too big for it (she's 2) or the product seems to not inflate all the way (but we've inflated it to the max, where it seems like it's about to burst).  She falls off easily and doesn't bounce well on it.  I thought it would be like the videos but instead of bouncing up and down my daughter seems to lose her balance on it quickly.  Maybe it's just because when I first gave this to my daughter she was still trying to balance out having a large head (don't toddlers look like cute bobble heads, lol) but her balancing skills are much better now.  I'll try to give it to her again and see if she can play with it more now.  Before she would bounce and go flying off the thing but I think she's gotten more skills at balancing the past 4 months and will be able to use this more in the spring.  I like it because it's adorable and seems like it will be a ton of fun once she gets used to the concept.

"Meena Harper is a typical woman living in NYC - she picks the wrong men, says the wrong things (aka predicts people's deaths), and attracts vampires. Okay, so maybe she isn't a typical NYC woman, but what she is is a fun character. In this sequel to Insatiable, readers are welcomed back into her life six months after the first novel ends.

As the novel opens, readers see Meena as a serious agent for the Palatine. Her brother Jon is still trying to get a job with the Palatine. Alaric still wants Meena. Lucien still wants to make Meena his bride.

And that's just the start of it. There is a rising vampire army hunting Meena; there is the Palatine hunting Lucien; and there is something ""off"" about the new members of the Palatine.

With a fast-paced plot and quite a few twists and turns throughout, Cabot has written an intriguing sequel. If you enjoyed Insatiable, you will not be disappointed with Overbite.

On a final note, I just want to say how much I really enjoy Cabot's taking on vampirism. She is clever, funny, and satirical, making these some of my favorite Cabot novels. This is the reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 4.",TRUE

"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

"Way before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s.

Having made a smash in ""The Karate Kid"" and the '60s-nostalgia TV series ""Call to Glory"", Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled Adventures in Babysitting.

Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date.

All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago.

Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too.

In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone) gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably.

Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.

This comedy flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987.",TRUE

"Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy. What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality. Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film. Just don't  expect a straightforward, linear story.",TRUE

"Well, this one was very short. To the point I was in no way ready for it to end. I just wanted it to keep going, to see what happened to Emily & Michael, because dayam is the reader left hanging at the end.

If this novella (or short, I guess) is a ploy to get readers to need to read on in the series, then congratulations, because the author has succeeded. This is definitely a great introduction to some of the character's in Kemmerer's Elemental world. I liked the two main character's a LOT. The writing has an easy simplicity to it that helps with the cadence of reading. It's full of conflict-romance, too, but without being overly mushy, which can sometimes happen in YA.

Though I'm left with quite a lot of questions: how their `powers' work because that isn't fully explained; the why and wherefore of it all isn't in here; I'm left unsure whether or not regular humans exist around these `special' folk, or of the hierarchical structure of it all and why certain families are expected to obey the requests of others/or stick to agreements made with them; there is evidently some kind of societal ladder and which rungs people belong on is obviously an important part of the world created here ...

"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus.",TRUE

"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.",TRUE

"Caroline Andrews and Josh Summers were the match that I was looking for in this series. They had different reasons for needing a second shot. Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

"I am very familiar with Carson, having owned a couple binoculars with HD glass. I used
those for surveillance work and for birding. One pair broke and they replaced them without
any questions. I very much appreciate the company. As for this monocular, I shopped around and looked at several and was about to pay a lot more
for a premium monocular when I decided that I didn't need it. I gambled on this unit, hoping
that I would not need the better glass of a more expensive one. It's a bit large, but I have
large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing.",TRUE

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.

"It's a nice enough story, but it's just a story. A really simple story presumably for beginner readers. It took me 2 minutes to read the whole book.

Each page has no more than a paragraph of large text and the adjoining page has a black and white illustration. I think the illustrations are the star of the book and probably why so many people enthuse over it. But really, there's no moral, no point, and it doesn't even make sense (how is Ferdinand the biggest and strongest bull when literally all he ever does is sit and smell flowers?)

I know it's a work for children, so I wasn't expecting much, but I was disappointed at how simple and pointless the work seems. I was expecting a book for around 4th-6th grade, not a black and white picture book. Meh.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does.",TRUE

"Unpacking this suitcase I was instantly impressed with the color, weight and durability of the case. The zippers move freely and once opened the case has compartments on both sides. The left side is your standard open suitcase compartment with straps to hold down clothes and a small zippered compartment on the side.

This will allow me to pack my toiletries without adding the bulk of a toiletry case. The bag also features a built in TSA approved lock which locks down the zipper pulls keeping your items secure yet accessible to TSA inspection. The four wheels allow for easy movement on both tile and carpet.

The only thing keeping me from rating this a perfect 5 stars is the fact that just opening and exploring the case with it the sides open onto ceramic tile caused slight scratching on the small popout logo in the front of the case.

"Machine Man is a fairly dark satire about the extent to which we covet technology. The first few pages are the most relatable as we meet our protagonist (if he can be called that) as he realizes he can't find his cell phone. While not everyone uses their cell phone for pretty much everything, most people could even relate to the way he feels by thinking about a time when you can't find the remote control for the television and spend 20 minutes looking for it rather than changing channels manually. Technology appears, and before you know it we don't know what we would do without it. This sets up the theme for the book as Charlie loses his leg in an accident at work. Being unhappy with the prostheses available to him he proceeds to build his own. Thus begins a journey to constantly Better himself, and though his designs are for his own use, his company quickly sees their marketability, not just for people who have lost their limbs, but for people who want better parts than they were born with. What follows is a tale of technology that progresses faster than we can really learn to deal with it, with disastrous consequences for all involved. The book is infused with a dry humor and insightful philosophy about our relationship to technology and only really lost my attention in the last third when it became more of an action movie. But it is a fun novel and I will probably pick up other books by Max Barry.",TRUE

"So, I wanted to remove an item from my tank. First, I should say, I have a 25G aquarium with a Cascade 700 filter. Which is a canister filter for aquariums up to 65G. Obviously I'm over filtering and it creates a strong current, which I like because I primarily do a planted tank.

Pros;
1) It kept my tank at a very stable 82 degrees. I kept it high on purpose as I breed German Blue Rams. It was fabulous, and I temp gauge always seemed to be working. It turned on/off appropriately.
I really like this stability because it can be harder to get it with glass/titanium heaters that are inside the aquarium.

2) Another item out of the tank! Seriously, it was so nice not having a heater in the tank.

Cons;
1) The main reason I'm sending this back is that it extremely and negatively impacted the water flow rate. In the instructions it says to put it on the outfilter tube -- and I did, but because this device has to be VERTICAL to avoid air bubbles getting trapped, rising to surface, and damaging it-- I had to have a lot of extra tubing. This significant drop in outflow made it impossible for it to properly aerate my water, and it also allowed for algae spores to settle.

Now, a solution to this would be ideally to put it into the infilter tube instead.  However, because I have a planted tank I ultimately decided against this. I didn't want to to deal with lots of gunk getting in the heater pipe. =/ I mean, that's the idea essentially to putting it on infilter over outfilter. It would be easy enough to clean out, but I looked at it as another frustration.

So, because of the cons, I ended up returning it. I mean, even with a circulation pump in my aquarium, I hated that the filter had been impacted so dramatically.",TRUE

"Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it.",TRUE
"It almost hurts to write a two star review for this speaker.  It's beautifully crafted and sounds great.

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.  I have battery powered Bluetooth speakers that don't have this ""feature""; why Polk decided to include it in an AC powered speaker makes no sense.  Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

Also, I haven't been able to keep the Airplay connection working for more than a few minutes.  I suppose this could be due to any number of factors, so I can't put this squarely on Polk, but that was one of the primary reasons I selected this particular model.",TRUE

Porter Rockwell was a real Mormon lawman and enforcer for the LDS.

Author Michael Newton delves into this and some Mormon history as the novel progresses.  How accurate that history is, I am not sure.  It fits generally with what I know but I don't know specifics of Mormon history and don't have enough interest in it to research all of the details in this novel.  Accurate or inaccurate history aside, the story is exciting, easy to read and a good western tale.  Although some of the writing is a little sloppy.

"""My secret, my obsession is worse than any of theirs. To contain it, I do the only thing I can. I lock myself up. And in doing so, keep myself, and everyone else, safe.""

This was an edgy book that explored the dark places we try to keep locked up inside of us, since they are not in compliance with societal norms or potentially are illegal. Who among us doesn't have these secrets? Of course, most of us don't go to the extreme of locking ourselves up for the safety and protection of others.

The book was a quick, but very gripping and entertaining read. The story is told from several points of view which makes for an interesting read as well. The pace moved along at a good clip, and then picks up as climax is nearing (no pun intended). Excellent suspense and many emotions are drawn out of the reader.

I was not familiar with the author prior to this book. I don't read in the genre she specializes in, erotica, but this book definitely falls more in the thriller genre, and I would read more of her books with this sort of a cross over. She is a talented writer.

I am not familiar with camming, but would expect that she got that pretty accurately. That aspect of the book was a nice twist. Not only does the main character have psychotic urges, and a dark past, but because she has locked herself up, she has become one of the country's premier web cammers to support herself. That combination makes for a very entertaining character who drew many different emotional responses from me.

This book was riveting in the same way that Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn was to me. A. J. Torre knocked this one out of the park! I will definitely read it again.",TRUE

Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book",TRUE

We gave him one to start out with so he doesn't get bored with a bunch of sticks at once. Well, he won't let it go except to play fetch. It's his new favorite thing ever. He loves it. He's going absolutely crazy. He only gets this way for feather toys and catnip sticks now apparently. GOOD BUY. Worth the money if you know how to keep cat toys interesting. Just play with your cat.

"Cary Grant was gorgeous, suave, a very good actor, and at times could be a controlling and confused man. Dyan Cannon writes about Mr. Grant with openness, and yes, is is HER autobiography as well as his biography in a sense. Covering the years from her start in Hollywood to just about the current day, Ms. Cannon does not hold back in her analysis of what made Mr. Grant tick. Having read several books by other authors, and having a film history background, there was little in the book that made me doubt Ms. Cannon's veracity. Cary Grant was open about his LSD experimentation and was constantly searching for depth and meaning in his personal life and retired at probably just the perfect moment; before his looks were regarded as passes to 1960s filmgoers and just as he himself was growing bored with his work.

The latter part of the book focuses on the repercussions of her marriage and life with Cary Grant and much was new and enlightening. (I do not spoil plots or details). A loving mother, continuing to act and work in films, Dyan Cannon has written a very good addition to the Hollywood biography canon.",TRUE

This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.,TRUE
"This is a very good LED lamp for the price. Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.

Pros:
The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base.
The light is very steady and there is no flicker.
The controls are easy to learn and access.
The finish is nice.
The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications.
The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles.
The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.

Cons:
The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base.
The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish.
The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in.
The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.

I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not. But at least you never have to change a light bulb!

"This is a fascinating, if slight, tale about one part of the massive Oxford English dictionary's creation. Basically, the story recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge portion of the world largest dictionary. The professor is the then editor who befriends the man, not knowing his new-found contributor resides in an insane asylum.
Along the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides.
I am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Yorker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses foreshadowing and previewing to ""fluff"" the work up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most important even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the story, the event was ""the most important event."" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This story is fascinating on its own.

"I've really enjoyed this series and feel this book is the best so far. Relationship issues between the main characters (Ivy, Rachel, Jenks, etc. ) are becoming more complex and less confusing. The author has really hit her stride in bringing all of these characters to life. The plot was fast-paced, resulting in me staying up way too late to finish it. Although the main character, Rachel, is getting stronger, she still has flaws and makes mistakes - keeping her real. The only (mild) criticism that comes to mind is the continued Ivy/Rachel angst. It hasn't hit overload yet, but I fear it might if it continues throughout the series. Overall, this was a great 5-star read for me.",TRUE
"Having seen a few episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 I knew what I was in for.

First, there would be a science fiction movie that if measured on its own merits would be absolute zero.
Second, the various characters on the ""space ship"" would be compelled to see the movie..
Third, the soundtrack of the movie would either be eclipsed by the ""viewers"" sarcastic comments or in the case the soundtrack was too painful to listen to, the space ship characters would happily substitute more of their own ideas.

"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!

"Run small. Buy a size larger. Great buy.......Fantastic comfort. I bought 3 packs, 9 pair. I will buy these forever, if you keep stocking them. I am so hooked on these boxer briefs. It was one of my best buys of 2014. I now have 9 pair, and if had the extra cash. I would buy 9 more pair. I took a chance on these & struck gold..... I am not one to get attached to my underwear, but these are the most comfortable I have owned in all my 63 yrs. of life. If I can, I will replace all my underwear with these. I should have bought more. They fit perfect in the pouch, and the comfort is top shelf for the money. Go ahead, go out and spend $20.00 a pair for underwear. I think that is rediculous  for underwear. After you wash them, they fit even better. Cannot be beaten for the money. Like I said, go a size larger. My extra large are perfect. I am 6'1"" & 210 lbs.

I cannot understand why their are any negative view points on this product. I too, took a chance on these Boxer Briefs, and like I said, I have 9 pair!. These could possibly sell much higher.

"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!",TRUE
"I was really surprised at the size and weight of this watch! I got it for my son who is very athletic, but he's not a big man! Tall, slender and fit...YES, but not bear-sized like one of the reviewers. :-) I feared that he wouldn't like it because of the size, but he certainly allayed that worry. He told me he even wore it while playing soccer and it was comfy, which surprised everyone.

Anyway, it's perfect for him and he loves it. We both agree that it's very attractive and sturdy. The green on the face adds just the right amount of eye-appeal without being flashy.

Truthfully, my son and I got into how ""pretty"" it is and how sports friendly, completely forgetting to comment on the accuracy of the time-piece...which is what any watch is all about, of course. :-) Well, when we finally got around to that, I learned that it's perfectly accurate. But with the INVICTA name, I'm not surprised.

Oh, it's just too lovely to describe... I hope you can get this and see for yourself.

Do study the manual that comes with it; makes it easier to understand the little intricacies of this phenomenal product.

Nothing else to say except that this is an amazing watch! Expensive, but well worth it because it's an upgrade from the other diver's watches on the market. Amazon's price can't be beat. (I saw the same brand at T.J. Maxx and even with their discount, it was much more than this.)

After a little work, I was able to install Ubuntu on this drive and dual-boot between Linux and Windows 8.1.  Booting into Linux is super fast, even compared to regular Linux boot times.

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.

Put it very briefly, get this book instead of the Ospreys. It covers not only infantry, cavalry, artillery but also naval warfare.

One can find numerous battles explained with maps, each detailing the successes of a particular use of cavalry, artillery or infantry.

"Very happy with the results!  My dogs were with a pet sitter for a week and used our landing instead of going outside. I was horrified. I cleaned everything right away, but had to watch them like a hawk. I was afraid they would re-soil the area. They did a few times. I ordered this and went over every area of carpet in my home. It gave me peace of mind to find all the spots and treat them. They don't seem to be sniffing around the landing like they were.

"One thing I find a bit inconvenient about this food is that I have to have a spoon or fork to get it out of the can with.  That's a trade off, because that means it's not all gravy and the cats get more real food for the catfood buck.  I also have to always chop it up because if I don't, my cats just look at it like ""What is this strange thing, mama?  You expect me to do what- exactly- with this?""

After chopping it up, the cats like it just fine.  I wouldn't say they love it.  They don't dance around when I open the can.  It's almost like they can't really tell what it is right off.  Once they realize it is food, they eat it all readily.

It has agreed well with my oldest, sickly cat.  She has breast cancer and a very sensitive tummy.  She hasn't thrown up eating it and she's been acting like she feels very good.  She's been totally curious about everything I do and very active.

I did feed it to several of the crew though, as a topper, and my youngest kitty - 8 months old- threw up all night the 2nd time he ate it.  The first time, he was fine.  The others were all fine so this might have just been a coincidence.",TRUE

"I am a full time dog trainer and I ordered this pouch in June. I wore this for 40 hours a week so I have to give some credit there, it held up pretty well for the amount of use. However, almost immediately the metal ring that stopped the cinch came out of the side of the bag and started to fray the material. I also did not have very good luck with the two sewn on straps next to the metal clip. They came out within the first month of me wearing the pouch. I had to use the cinch fairly often because dogs would find the pouch and stick their snoot in while I was talking to the owners, so I would cinch it closed. I finally ordered a new pouch in November (Doggone Good), so it took 6 months before I couldn't wear it any longer.

However, I did enjoy several features of the pouch which it seems my new pouch does not have. I could fit my iPhone 6 in the front zipper pocket easily so I could pull it out when I needed to make appointments or phone calls. As a woman, my pockets are very small so I am not sure where I am going to put my phone now. I also love the waste bag dispenser. I wholesaled ordered a bunch of waste bags so I was able to keep 3-5 rolls on me at a time, I never ran out. My new pouch only has room for two rolls. The metal clip on the back, even though I did not have the sewn straps, was very convenient and I could clip and unclip it from my belt very easily. I also liked that I could slip little things into the front mesh pocket, like prong collar links. So the bag isn't awful for the average dog owner, but won't withstand professional use.

I have included some pics so you can see how it looked the day I replaced it. The cinch area was in pretty rough shape at this point.",TRUE

"This was an interesting book.  There were parts that ran a little dry for me, as a duffer who knows next to nothing about neuroscience.  It was very accessible, easy to understand and follow; if anything, the dry parts were due to more depth than I needed.  But it simply showed the author's careful adherence to due diligence, offering solid evidence for the conclusions she drew.  The writing was clear and professional and easy to read; there were a couple of very fun optical illusions in the early chapters, and I wish there had been more visuals, more images and graphics, for the reader's sake, but such would be unnecessary; merely fun.

I was fascinated by the concept of the book, that optimism is a necessary and beneficial adaptation in our species, provided it doesn't go too far.  I am a former and still occasional optimist, of the type that went too far; I smoked for more than fifteen years, somehow managing to ignore the obvious damage I was doing to myself, and the fact that two of my grandparents died of tobacco-influenced lung cancer.  Because surely those things wouldn't happen to young, strong me!  Surely the damage that smoking does to a person was mitigated by my own magnificence and dumb luck!  As I have aged, however -- and particularly as I have spent the last dozen years trying to teach English to American teenagers in a public school -- my optimism has decreased markedly.  But it was in some ways very inspiring to me to read about the benefits of continued *reasonable* optimism, especially coming from a scientist rather than a self-help snake oil salesman.

"I am a big Beatles fan but always had mixed feelings about John. He was obviously a great musician and showman. His Imagine album is wonderful, and his plea for peace in the title song is downright anthemic for the peace movement. He truly believed in love; his favorite lyric was ""All you need is love."" At the same time, for much of his life he was often nastily sarcastic, hotheaded, and abusive, especially when drinking. My understanding of his boyhood before I saw this film was that Lennon liked to exaggerate how difficult his situation had been, separated from his mother and raised by his Aunt Mimi, when in reality he had a very comfortable, secure, middle-class upbringing. I continued to hold this view throughout the film, thinking how good he had it: a reunion with a mother who was fun, doting, and indulgent while being watched over by a strict, but loving, aunt. That is, until the moment when Mimi revealed to him exactly the circumstances of the loss of his father and separation from his mother. Then I got it. And when he finally lost his mother for good, I can see why he described his growing up years as hard. I have much more sympathy for him now.",TRUE

"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

"I ordered two of these dresses--- in black and blue chevron stripes. I have yet to see the blue one, so I cannot comment on it. The black one, though, is great. It is made of a slinky polyester material that stretches a bit. It does fit slightly large (I ordered a small), and I wonder if the length is meant to be shorter. I am about 5 ft 4 in, and it goes to the bottom of my knees. I am a 34C/D bra size, and there is plenty of room in the chest. So far, I've worn it with knee high black boots, and it makes a cute outfit. As far as what others think, from the moment I put it on, I received compliments from multiple complete strangers saying, ""I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you I LOVE your dress!""  Of course, that kind of reaction is always a plus. I have worn this three times already. It is very comfortable. It has been well-received both in the casual and professional executive work environments. I hope the blue one is just as nice.

"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it.",TRUE

"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy.",TRUE

"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing.....",TRUE

"3.5*
This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment.",TRUE

"I have narrow feet and a high arch, so need a shoe that has good arch support, good cushioning and low volume but still roomy toe box that is not too stiff.  I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).

I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.

The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.

The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.

The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions.",TRUE

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook.

Every heli I've flown has it's own characteristics. Some are quick, others sluggish, some fast, others are touchy. This one is just plain weird! A curved left, in high speed makes it almost stop and spiral up. A right curve, if done just a little to fast, causes it to do a motorcycle-type high-side, causing the upper and lower blades to collide, causing an instant crash!

"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.",TRUE

I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

"I'm discriminating. Willing to pay for better/best quality. However, I planned to use this for a Disney Trip (2 adults, 2 kids) and I wanted a carry on as a back pack (to free my hands for car seats), then a smaller back pack for the park (instead of just a wheeled backpack only which would have been much bigger in the park than I wanted). This was fantastic. No problems on domestic flight with wheeled part (with day pack zipped off). Fit no problem straight in. Squishing straps great. I did NOT have much trouble with the pull arm as some reviewers, slight sticking at times but better than most of my luggage (NOT as good as my Victorinox for a comparison, but still very good). Zippers heavy duty and work well. Day pack holds much more than I expected, more like a true backpack (I had expected a little larger than a fanny pack. This is MUCH larger than that.). Water bottle slots hold CamelBak style bottles fine. Little compartment at top for earphones, charger, inhaler, medicines and front compartment held sunglasses, wipes, sunblock stick, snacks, etc. Main compartment had two rain jackets, two sweaters, magazines, sandwiches, snacks, baseball caps. My wife didn't really have to carry anything in the park. Even with all that, it slid right under the seat no problem, with room for my feet still. Some noted trouble zipping the day pack onto the main pack when full. I didn't bother as it has a nice ""hold a bag"" strap (like the Victorinox) that worked great, so didn't bother zipping on. If both full of hard objects, I could see some trouble, but if relatively flat, should zip on no problem. However, look around!! I found for just under $100 elsewhere. For that it was a steal. For the $175-200 range, I still think it is worth it (now that I have it). Bite the bullet, you are really getting two really good bags for one.",TRUE

This stuff can be made a mess pretty easily with a crappy blade.  The 80T did a wonderful job on the ply and solid materials.  Almost no tear out/splintering on the ply and the cuts on the solid stock where beautiful.  This blade cuts as well as my $150 Tenyru.  Time will tell how well/long it stays sharp.  Will post more info in a few weeks.

UPDATE.....been using the blade for a couple of weeks.  Still sharp.  The thing that sets this blade apart, and all good blades, is the ability to cut small amounts from small mouldings and leave them laying on the table rather than sending them off like a missle.  This blade has not thrown anything yet!  Will be purchasing another one as a back up.",TRUE

Now her days consist of investigating cheating douche bags, but as she likes to eat, she has no choice.  Moon controls Arizona's largest crime syndicate.  Mak and Moon cross paths when both are trying to catch the same guy,  and set sparks flying everywhere.  She can't get over how absolutely hot he is, and he's decided he wants her.  After Mak finds herself in danger, she must turn to Moon for help, as she can't trust the police.  Will Mak be able to keep the blue eyed Moon at arms length the more time they spend together?

"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is a Star Trek fan, and I'm not one of those people. But I am a Star Trek fan. The basic premise of the movie is that the crew of a space ship in the 21st century is infected by a virus that gives them the ability to control their own behavior. As they become infected, the crew become increasingly violent and insane. As the infected crew becomes more violent and insane, they become more violent and insane. The movie begins to get a little slow, but as it goes on, it becomes more realistic. The aliens seem to be having a blast, and it's kind of scary that they get on the ship and are able to control their behavior. It's a nice twist to the story. It's also a little hard to figure out who the good guys are. In the first movie, the bad guys were pretty bad. I guess this movie was trying to be a bit of a sci-fi horror movie, but it was a little too dark for me. I was hoping for a more more ""serious"" twist, but it just doesn't work.

sad to say, but I have to take down 2 star... these toys are awesome little things that my dog loves to throw in the air and catch, but the squeakers inside are horrible! The squeakers inside last about an hour, but they never squeak again... they're very poorly made. The squeaker inside has two parts and the little thing that makes the squeaker squeak always slides out. Then the squeaker part always gets smashed within an hour that my dog gets bored of it. That's the only problem with this toy which is kind of a big deal since the whole point is for it to squeak! Anyways they are very durable and if you just replace the squeaker, your dog will be able to enjoy this toy for a very long time :)",TRUE

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.

I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them.",TRUE

"I bought this for my 5 year old, and he LOVES it. Let's start with the good:

1. The pictures on the dice are fun and great for a Mario fan.
2. This is a great game to help younger kids who are learning to add and write numbers. It is also good in that it helps teach strategy.
3. Adults can have fun playing as well since we remember this game from when we were young.
4. Everything fits nicely in the question mark box when you are done playing.

The not so good:

1. I had to coat the dice with clear nail polish as a preventative measure to keep the graphics from wearing off (thank you to the reviewer who suggested that)
2. The score cards are really small and for a little kid trying to write numbers, it can be hard to fit the writing into the space allotted. But I have to say that I don't think the score cards are all that much smaller than the yahtzee we used to play. And, as someone else pointed out, the pages are easily scanned and enlarged. The only problem there is that larger papers would not fit so neatly in the box.
3. There is a glaring typo on the scorecard. Not a big deal for adults, but confusing for a five year old.

Overall, for the price, you will get hours of enjoyment from this game. And even if it is not the most durable or well made game, for under 20 dollars, I think it is fine. Especially if you have a Mario fan!",TRUE

"Kia can start fires without matches. It just happens and there's nothing she can do to stop it, fire is a part of her. She's got fiery red hair and when she gets emotional there are flames she can't control. She was kicked out of school because of a fire she started and is now living with her grandmother, who works on a large estate. Being there brings Kia more questions than answers. She finds out the hard way that the surrounding forest isn't safe. There are creatures she's never seen and they aren't very friendly.

Ethan is used to everything that lurks in the shadows. He knows a lot of terrible secrets and is carrying a heavy burden. He likes Kia from the start, but he knows she isn't safe at the estate. He keeps his distance, but Kia is too smart for him to continue hiding things. He's afraid of what will happen if she finds out the truth, there are sanctions Ethan wouldn't wish on anyone, especially Kia. Will he be able to protect her and does she actually need to be protected?

Red is a great story about an interesting house with a fascinating forest. I loved reading about each creepy creature and like Alyxandra Harvey's vivid imagination.

Alyxandra Harvey's vivid descriptions of the forest and everything that's lurking there are fabulous.

"Proof positive that what makes as great movie is the writing.  Don't get me wrong, this film looks great, but you can tell it did not have the giant blockbuster budget that some films have, but the director and camera crew make it look like a million dollars anyway.  And more importantly it has fantastic script, mood, and great actors! This is a thnking man's, or woman's, movie. it is also very much in the film noir vein.  Films to compare it to would be Dark City or the first Boerne Identity movie.  Through out the movie our main character has identity issues and as has been stated previously, Jeremy Northam's tranformation is incredible, subtle, and in my opinion, Oscar worthy! It has been said by some that the plot has holes or doesn't make sense in places. I have plotted it out meticullously and i can find a hole anywhere.  Because the plot is involved it is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. Much like watching ""The Usual Suspects"" for the second & third time. Something else I think is noteworthy is that while most of the movie is kind of cold and lonely,as it should be, as our hero goes on his quest where no one can be trusted, at the very end of the movie we are treated to a very warm, hopeful, satisfying ending. All the cast are perfect.  Lucy Lui has the perfect demeanor for this role. Many times it is hard to read her and thereby to know if she can be trusted.  Finally, let me end with stating this is in my Top-10 movies of all times along with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  In the Mouth of Madness by John Carpenter, as well as many other horror and Sci-fi films.

"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever.",TRUE

"I am a big fan of books on the history of science and technology. This book is a valuable addition to my collection.

In this book, the author makes a good argument for the screwdriver being the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. It seems like such a simple invention, yet he demonstrates via good research the importance and discovery of the screwdriver. He makes a less-well researched claim to the history of the screw.

Many tools that we commonly use are much more ancient than the last millennium-the hammer, axe, plane, and so forth are ancient tools, well developed in Roman times. Yet the screw and screwdriver, essential today, are fairly new, developed during the late middle ages or early renaissance periods.

One of the best parts of the book is chapter 5, where not only reveals the 'first' screwdriver, but information on Henry Maudslay, Jesse Ramsden. Joseph Whitworth, Joseph Clement, Richard Roberts, and James Nasmyth, most of whom I had never heard of before. Maudslay and this small group of mechanical geniuses were the people who 'invented precision' as another writer put it. In other words, this group devised the machine tools required for precision work. They are mentioned in this book because a lot of their work revolved precision screws, their use and manufacture.

That's one of the things that I like about this kind of history. One good book can lead to an area of discovery and knowledge that the reader might not know about. Since reading this book, I have become interested in the history of machine tools and their inventors.

A good book, well written. Recommended.

"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these.",TRUE

"I have pops of teal and blue, as my accent colors, in my home, so was really happy to come across this piece. It comes with a lightweight wood tray, which can either be used with the tealights, or with something else. Their are 9 tealight holders, in the set, of varying heights, colors and textures. The great thing is, since there are 9 tealight holders, you could actually break them up and use some in other areas too. Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light.

"The problem with buying a dress shirt, is that they are cut to fit 95% of the guys out there. So they are boxy. However, deviate from the norm, then you'll end up with a shirt that isn't long enough (if you're tall), maybe doesn't close around the stomach (if you're chubby), or pinches around the shoulders and upper arms (if you're muscular). I have the problem of shirts too tight around my shoulders and upper arms. Also, I can't move my arms forward without restriction, because it's too tight across the back. Sometimes I move up to a 2XL, but then it's way too baggy around my stomach. I have no idea what those muscleheads do who are jacked up on gear, but just being thick and solid, causes me problems enough. Since my thighs are pretty strong, I have problems with pants that I can sit down in too. That's when I discovered spandex woven into the cloth. If you're bulked up from the gym, its the only option you have, unless you want to buy clothes way oversized, and wear a belt. This shirt fits me well. It isn't tight around my arms and shoulders, since the cloth has give, when I move my arms. The waist doesn't billow over my waist either. I have long arms, but it fits well with arm length. The fabric has give, but it's not elastic the way socks are for example. Also you can forget to hang this shirt on a hanger, and still be able to wear it the next day without ironing. (It smooths out, when you have it on.) I like the blue graph paper design. Best of all, I'm not pinched around my chest and back either.

My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold.  This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.  That is OK with me.  Overall this doggy door gives me and the dogs so much more freedom to do our thing!  Yes I do love it!",TRUE

"After discovering how harmful rawhide chews, treats, bones etc. I went on a search to find a healthy alternative for my 3 mo. old puppy. I was amazed to find how healthy sweet potato strips and fries were for all dogs as there are no harmful ingredients in them and they contain no other ingredients except sweet potato, period. At first my dog was confused, however offering nothing else but the sweet potato, she quickly decided to give them a try. She takes them to her bed and enjoys them tremendously. Biting off small pieces and chewing each piece thoroughly and completely before swallowing. The bag contains a lot of strips, and lasts a long time.  I will never give my dog any type of rawhide, and my wish is that people would just research how rawhide of any type is processed from beginning to end, and they will discover how harmful if not deadly rawhide is for your beloved pet.

"This is my second Kristan Higgins book, and while Ive long grown past reading straight-up romance novels  a staple of my jr. high and high school reading list  someone I trust recommended Higgins to me as smarter and more sarcastic than you average, cloying Harlequin formula and suggested I give her a try.

This is actually a sequel, of sorts, to The Best Man, the other Higgins novel I read, where it focuses on the romance of a side character from that novel in the same quirky upstate New York town. (Apparently, there are also several others featuring the same group of friends and family which Higgins has dubbed, The Blue Heron Series.)

Not quite as sharp as the Best Man, it did follow a similar path, with stubbornly single bar owner Colleen, who loves to set up everyone else, but resists falling in love herself after being badly burned by a former flame. And guess who happens to show up in Colleens bar one day? Yep, the one that got away, Lucas.

This isn't groundbreaking, and it gets to same destination as youd expect from a romance title, but Higgins does it with a lot more panache than your average rote, romance author. Witty dialogue, cliche-free conversation and a healthy dose of snark, all combined with a still sweet and, well, romantic romance.

Entertaining and perfect poolside reading, Ive heard the very smart Linda Holmes, of NPR, cite Higgins as one of the few contemporary romance authors she enjoys reading. Id have to agree.",TRUE

She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday.

Together Gwil and Penda struggle to survive in the time when ""god and his saints slept"".

The story is recounted by an abbot on his deathbed to a young scribe. The character's are varied: Maud, a young noblewoman who is traded back and forth between the two sides in the war as if she was as much a piece of property as her actual property; William, Maud's stepson who is torn between devotion to his awful father and Maud; King Stephen and Empress Mathilda; and various other players. The action is constant, and is both mental and physical as the characters try to stay alive in the brutal war. And then there is the evil monk...who is he, and why does he have such power?

Take a damp cloth and wipe ball down and brush again. After it dried I brushed again to bring the shine and tack back. I used a paper towel and some dye came off but this is normal.

"The Nokia SU-8W Bluetooth keyboard (Cordless) is a great deal for the price.  The keyboard is small enough to fit most portable keyboards and the touchpad is great.  The only drawback is that the keys are slightly larger than standard keyboards.  The keys are also not as long as standard keys but I think it will be a problem for some people.

The rubberized coating on the end should last a while if we keep it from dragging all over the ground.

Compared to synthetic/poly climbing ropes bought by some friends (on Amazon), it is much easier to hold and grip. It's not slippery like they are. I think this one is much safer for the little hands.

"Being in the dentist's chair is usually an uncomfortable and anxious place to be, but this story turns it around and puts the dentist on the spot. As he pokes and prods with his instruments, he is soon distracted by his patient's new accessory. The doctor has seen plenty of tongue rings but never one quite like this. It's very odd and makes him feel as if someone is watching him. As he continues his examination, he is soon troubled and scared by what he finds.

This story is maybe a fifteen-minute read, but it doesn't short-change the reader that feeling of expectation. There is a nice feeling of suspense for the reader as we wait to see exactly what the good doctor will discover in what is supposed to be a routine exam. From the well-chosen book cover with its unnerving stare to the patient's startling and ominous revelation, it all comes together for a good and kind of creepy read.",TRUE

I can get past that part but there's a lot of talk about all the guys who want to be with Auden throughout and it gets a little ridiculous.

"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.",TRUE

"I am a young teen who recently read this book and I personal believe that  this book is pretty innocent compared to the ""The Big Nate"" series. It Has intelligent humor unlike the big Nate series too. there is not a lot of disrespectfulness of other people in this book and it dosen't have bad messages unlike big Nate. The reason I am comparing it to big Nate series is because I am aware that both books are very popular and funny, but I have read big Nate, and i would agree that it has a very bad message, with unintelligent humor, and many inappropriate scenes. I would prefer children reading diary of a wimpy kid more so then the school drop-out who likes to skip school big Nate. In diary of a wimpy kid the main character is not a school drop-out But does talk a little bit about girls, but not a lot. Diary of a wimpy kid deals with some problems that people may face in real life in the dramatic middle school, like problems with friends, bullying, and looking ""cool"",  but the author took these problems and added some funny spice to them to make it a Funny novel that children can laugh at and say, ""I know exactly how he feels, but how did he deal with it? I think i am going to read on to find out."" this book is a great and funny series that is overall innocent and deserves only the best. It makes children want to read the addicting book.

The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.
By the way don't bother calling the ""technical service number"", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.com

"The Mega Fun 93628 Marble Fun Run has been a delight for my children to play with. This set has allowed them open ended play to build and discover for hours at a time. It's been fun watching them work and seeing them try to speed up or slow down their marbles to get to the bottom first. It's a good set to enhance problem solving skills, spatial reasoning, and so much more!

The set comes with 105 pieces and this includes 30 marbles. There are instructions to build the run on box, if so desired. The variety of pieces vary from curvy, straight, a loop de loop, starter areas with little levers, pieces that have detachable and re-attachable wheels, and more! Some of the pieces are translucent with sparkle and the rest are solid colors. The variety of colors this set is made up of makes it gender neutral. My son and daughter ages 7 and 4 years old have played with this set on their own as well as together.

This set is well made and the pieces stay together once hooked up together. I would suggest parents to put the little levers and tabs in the pieces they are meant for. My son tried to do this on his own and ended up breaking one of the pieces. With that being said, he tends to be a little rough on things. Other than that small mishap we've had no issues of the set showing wear or breaking easily.

I would certainly recommend this set. It's great for down-time during the afternoons or on days when the weather just too hot or rainy to enjoy outside. One thing I like is that more sets can be purchased to make an even bigger marble run! My kids said that they love playing with it and I am glad they do too! *I received a sample of this product for review purposes *",TRUE
"This is impossible to keep clean.  I empty the water completely and refill daily, and I take the stupid thing apart and clean it thoroughly weekly, but it still gets slimy and icky.  Taking it apart and cleaning should be simple and straightforward.  They are not.  Even with sponges, bottle brushes and toothpicks, there are still crevices that stubbornly hold on to the goobies that end up in my cats water.  Taking the motor apart is a huge pain, and I didn't even know I was supposed to do that until I dropped the unit while cleaning, and the lever that is supposed to control the water flow (that, in fact, does nothing) broke off.  I looked inside the motor and found slimy cat hairs and a goobie the size of marbles stuck inside!  You shouldn't have to break something to figure out you need to clean it.  I had been scrubbing the motor's plastic grating with an old toothbrush, but that wasn't enough work I guess.

My cats love it, but I will never purchase another one. I'll find a bubbly fountain that provides safe and clean water to the cats without driving the humans crazy!",TRUE

"Oh my gosh I was so happy to receive this ARC, in exchange for an honest review.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books.",TRUE

"I recently loaned this dvd to a young queer who told me they had no idea that homosexuality was illegal in the United States until 1969. This young person is 22 years old.  Needless to say, the documentation of queer history is sorely lacking. Fortunately the American Experience, which always delivers perfect, entertaining yet respectable productions of historical American time capsules, has approached this subject/story of when gay men and women in America stood up to the police (and the mafia) and said ""No more"".  This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969.

You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story.  You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trials suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexuals in human history, you'll agree that the methodic efforts to obliterate this sector of society has been continuous and is still alive today.

"From the very beginning of this series, I knew that Gretchen de la O had given us a gem. What I hadn't expected was the respectful, slow and magical transition from YA to more Adult. You literally feel like you are growing up with Wilson Mooney, our heroine of the series.

In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.

However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.

A beautiful series written for the hopeless romantic in all of us, Gretchen does not disappoint with the HEA and delivers a book boyfriend the teenage girl and young lady in all of us dreamed existed.",TRUE

"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon.",TRUE

"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility.

Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser. Then you attach it to your chain and attempt to backpedal. The gears complain and water sloshes out from both sides because it has much more friction than you expected. You eventually find a hand position that keeps it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through.

The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matters is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minutes of running the chain in both directions.

Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towels (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small links too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing.

If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together. Then put it in a soda bottle with ten or twelve ounces of citrus degreaser and shake for a minute or two. Short of an ultrasonic cleaning or soaking the chain in petroleum solvents and scrubbing it with a brush, that's as clean as it's going to get.",TRUE

"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot.
With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered.
Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband?
As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years.
Ms. Wainscott's latest is a masterpiece of mystery, chock full of suspense, and brimming with romantic attraction. Readers unfamiliar with this rising star's work will definitely want to check out this latest suspenseful novel.",TRUE

The characters are real and complex and the plot is captivating. But more than that, it's a book that shows the humanity of different individuals, while not shying away from the brutality of others. Using Death as the narrator adds another dimension to the novel. Nothing is new to Death, and yet he is moved and intrigued by this story and shares it with us, showing us the complexity of humanity. The Book Thief is the best contemporary young adult book I've read. I know some people feel it was wrongly marketed that way, but I think it fits the audience well, while not writing down to them. The voice and style are distinct enough to make it feel special, while the subject matter and characters are real enough to tell a great deal of truth about the human condition.

3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

I don't enjoy adventure stories all that much. I need my brain to be stimulated by conniving plot twists or revealing secrets or a romance. Adventure stories don't provide that for me.

This story is pretty much documenting Leah's journey West once she discovers the truth about her uncle. I wanted gun fights and showdowns, not the dark reality of a pilgrimage West.

That being said, the realism is one of the highlights of the novel for me. What I really enjoyed about this book was that it was very realistic. The pilgrimage to the West was a gruesome and often deadly journey for those who decided to try it. Whether it was for gold or a new life of freedom, some people and families found it to be worth the risk and I think that is all beautifully represented here.

"Positives:
Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations.
Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on.",TRUE

"(My picture shows LeapPad WITH the gel skin case on-sold separately)
My 3.5 year old son loves his ""tablet!"" We have cartridge games, and have purchased games directly on the tablet. Super easy to navigate. The camera, video recorder, and voice recorder are actually his favorite features. I cannot compare this tablet to other LeapPads, as this is the first one we have owned, but we do love it. It seems the biggest difference is this tablets ability to play imagicard games. We personally found the cards are nuisance, and don't use them. You don't even really need them,  but we do love the Paw Patrol Imagicard game...we just play without the cards. We did have an issue with it freezing on us once, but we're able to reset, and it's never done that again. A real tablet like an iPad obviously runs faster, has a better resolution, and more features, but the LeapPads are Ad free, which means this Mommy is worry free! I hated all the ads and pop-ups that occurred when my son plays games on our tablet or phones. Everything he plays on the LeapPad is educational, unlike many of the pointless games he played on the iPad. I also scored my tablet right before Christmas for around $65 dollars! That's right, this LeapPad platinum cost me $65! I price watched using CamelCamelCamel.com. So in short, certainly no iPad, but much more clean educational entertainment than an iPad....so IMO a better purchase!",TRUE

The jacket comes very stiff, but softened up after washing once. After a few more washed I feel that it will mold even better. It is insulated and fairly thick.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.

"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

"The Three Laws are:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Although the author didn't state the Laws in the story she did refer to them.  In my opinion if they could break one, why couldn't they break another.  If so, then why did they need the mechanic.

Dunn is a space engineer that that goes from planet to planet for jobs.  He wakes up from hypersleep to handle his latest job, to fix the communications of a planet from which nothing has been heard for over twenty years.

I enjoyed the clear crisp writing, in the style of the early masters.  Up until the end, when I realized that the laws had been broken even though the author implied that the robots couldn't break the laws.  To be specific, the robots should not have been able to allow harm to come to any of the humans.

In addition, as to the last paragraph there was no foreshadowing or any support for what was happening.

So while I would love to read more by this author, I hope that she will stick to the rules she creates in her universe(s), or explain how/why they were broken or by-passed.

While I didn't like the rule breaking, I did like the story.

They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread.

After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use.

"Everlasting Fun Treat Ball / B0009YD8NS

I have several treat dispensing toys for my puppy, and I like this one the least. The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used. To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!

That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy. Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for ""treat gorging"" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer). However, if you want an easy to fill ball that can hold kibble and enliven dinner time, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Tricky-Treat-Ball/dp/B0002DK26M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball</a>.",TRUE
"I wanted to upgrade from my Intex inflatable 2-person kayak, which introduced me to the great joy of kayaking.

Im 57 and 240 lbs and this kayak was super stable, easy to maneuver on the water, and I can lift it and get it tied down on top of my car by myself.

"Overall does what a hub should do. Works 100% with powered devices like printers and scanners. But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.

"New Beginnings Phyllis is second novella in the Zimmerman Academy Shorts series by Kathi Daley. This is a spinoff of the Zoe Donovan series. This short story is told from Phyllis Kings perspective. The early chapters were originally included in several of the recent Zoe Donovan series books. Im looking forward the growth and changes in Phyllis life since joining the faculty at Zimmerman Academy and opening her home to Brooklyn Banks, Pepper Pepperton, and Eve Lambert. The novella ends with a mystery surrounding an unpublished manuscript. Phyllis friends, Hazel, Luke and Ethan explore a donated book written in 1956 and recognize women today experience many situations, frustrations and emotions as women did long ago. They, also, delve into the history of Ashton Falls formerly known as Devils Den. The day ends with an amazing birthday party for Phyllis surrounded by her friends.

Kathi Daleys novella is a quick, enjoyable read which flows smoothly. Even in the novellas, the characters are well developed and the setting readily transports the reader into the world that she has created; one in which the reader feels as if they are visiting with friends. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted cozy mystery with lovable characters. I am looking forward to reading more books written by this author. If you have not had the opportunity to read Ms. Daleys books, be sure to become acquainted with each of her series (each uniquely themed and superbly written).

"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movies about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right?  There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. ""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. ""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play. Two other interesting tidbits about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman was Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter was Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein.",TRUE

I even made my mother read them, and she loved them as much - if not more - as I did.

Anne Brashares really delves deeply into each girl. They are not simply characters to make the book happen, but characters with feelings, emotions and problems that we can all relate to. They each have real relationships with their mothers, they are loyal and devoted to each other, and they have problems which they deal with honestly. Things like that in a book can't help but make it a good read, don't you think?

I certainly hope that Anne Bashares writes more for the series because I will be first on line to by them!

Happy reading!",TRUE

"I love this book, I just do. From the original character names to the wholly original plot to that cover that screams, ""READ ME!"" It's hard not to fall in love with Laini Taylor's debut novel and I can see why this book has garnered so much attention. It is flawless written with lush words that fill the pages, enticing the reader deeper and deeper into the book.

Karou--I seriously just love that name--is a phenomenal lead. Seeing the world through her eyes was beautiful and exhilarating. She is the tip of the amazing-character-iceberg. I love her and Akiva. They are literary gold, and I cannot get enough of them. Just please, give me more. NOW.

There is something that is pure magic about certain books, and Daughter of Smoke and Bone has it. There are few books on my shelves I will reread because I am in awe of the way a writer places the words together to make a sentence full of enchantment. I can safely say this book has earned that distinction. Many books are good, have fun plots or witty characters, but it's the places in between the action, in between the dialogue, that draw me in. It's the space between the heartbeats of a novel that win me over and fuse with my heart.

For a book so large, the ending came entirely too fast. I was left desperate for more at the end, and with too many questions that really need answering. I suppose that is the mark of a great book--leave them panting for more, right? If that is the ultimate goal, Taylor has it in spades.

"Let me just start out by saying that I read this book, and don't understand why it got so many negative reviews, or why its average rating is only 3 stars. I guess that's the great thing about listening to your gut and ignoring reviews.... many times people's reading experiences are so personal that it just doesn't pay to read a book based on others' reviews.
This book is basically a collection of different people's life stories. These are people Bronson handpicked to interview, based on how interesting or believable he found their story to be. All of the people interviewed have somehow found a more fulfilling, more rewarding life, but usually not before years of struggle. Many of these stories deal with career, but not all. It becomes apparent that often happiness is a tricky thing, to be found in places where you don't expect it.
One of my favorite stories was the one of the guy who was getting a PhD in English but then ended up becoming a chef. Another one I liked was about the guy who wanted to work in golf. I thought every one of these stories were interesting, and believable.
What I liked the most about this book was its desire to probe life and reality as they are, instead of getting bogged down in neat or too-simple self help explanations or methods. Believe me, I have read a few self-help books during challenging times. Believe me, they did not work. The reason, I think, is because often they provide you with too-ready theories of life instead of encouraging you to think for yourself to find the best solution for yourself. This book doesn't do that. Instead, it makes you realize (at least it made me realize) that achieving contentment is not as simple as we want to think, but it's something that's still possible with a lot of patience, time, and perseverance. (And some luck).",TRUE

"Lifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock, 1944)

You take a John Steinbeck story, have Jo Swerling (Pennies from Heaven) adapt it, and get Alfred Hitchcock to direct, with a cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and Walter Slezak, among others. How can you not have a hit?

Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way. And that's pretty much what Hitchcock does; each of these characters is invested with a distinct, well-drawn personality, and given the situation, they're bound to clash on their own. Change a camera angle here and there, perhaps, but let the characters do their thing. There's a minimal plot (regarding, of course, the eeeeeeeeevil German-- let's remember this film was released during the darkest days of World War II), but this is a movie that's really about these characters and how they interact with one another. And it's fascinating.",TRUE

The author also has a great ability to conjure up emotions--some tender and sweet, others sad and melancholy.

"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.  I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worries me a bit as I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup.",TRUE

"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed.

"This first- person narrative account of the years that Tavis Smiley spent in the company of Dr. Maya Angelou is a real eye opener.  I did not know that he had access to her in such a personal way through a friendship that lasted over 20 years.  She took him under her wing and it helps explains his success as one of the best interviewers I have seen.  Tavis, whom I admire, lets his guests speak what is in their hearts with little interruption yet through skillful guidance.  All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.

"Unfolding like a thriller, Winged Obsession recounts the dogged efforts of U.S. Fish and Game agent Ed Newcomer to lasso his man, Yoshi Kojiyama, a Japanese butterfly smuggler who fancies himself the ""Indiana Jones of butterfly smuggling.""  You could not make up a character like Yoshi.  His personality is truly unique and could only exist in real life.  A fictional person such as he would be laughed off the page.
This book is so rich, filled with so many fascinating elements, and from the very beginning, the reader knows he will not be able to put it down.  Jessica Speart is an unusual combination of nature enthusiast  expert and mystery writer, which makes the varying elements of her story hang together so well.  The reader not only gets much information about butterflies and beetles, and the  black market world behind their collection, but also a ripping good story about a heroic agent who won't stop until he gets his man, no matter what it takes.  Included  is a description of his case against pigeon breeders that is totally apart from the central narrative and could support an entire book on its own.  This is also an entire treatise on the nature of obsession and the need to own the rare, the exotic, the item on the verge of extinction.  ""The rarer the more unusual, the fewer, and the weirder something is, the more it's in demand by people in the trade.""  There will be understandable comparisons to The Orchid Thief, but Winged Obsession is better written, more accessible, funnier and scarier than that one.",TRUE

"5'6"" and 125. I have literally tried on about 30 pairs of jeans this year. Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there.

Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans!

"I am impressed with each and every 'Reproduction Barbie Doll' that I own. I bought one for each of my four granddaughters, with the hopes of keeping this iconic legend alive. Barbie is educational because she encourages socialization and etiquette through role play. Of course, you need more than just the doll. I also bought the basic accessories and a few extras. A school classroom set will add to the fun. Also, a dining room, table and chair set with miniature dishes will teach the girls how to set a proper table and reinforce manners. However, the real role playing can only be taught by a good role model. That includes explaining that Barbie's body measurements are not realistic. This could lead to a discussion about being comfortable with our curves or lack thereof. Maybe even a discussion of anorexia versus obesity. That is why I highly encourage mothers (and grandmothers) to spend some time playing with their daughters. The magic moment is when you watch your girls playing alone or with friends and see how they reflect your positive influence. That, in turn, is carried throughout a lifetime. There's a reason Barbie is such a beloved, classic icon.",TRUE

I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and fair review of the item and I have found myself to be very happy with my purchase.,TRUE

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I figured I would see if TL is any better.  I was surprised that the battery was already hooked up and fully charged when the device arrived.  I let it run for two days.  First day had no load and second had a minimal load.  Tonight I installed the unit in my media center.  So far I have had no issues and no smell as reported by others.  I currently use this UPS in my media center to keep a TV, sound system, CATV box and DVD running.  Current full load is without the DVD and usage is at 37%.  With everything turned off, I still see a draw of 9%.

"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book.

""Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up. Tears fall in our lives like leaves from a tree. Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible.

Should the tree's giving be contingent on the boy's gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed. ""
So whoever that rated low for this book, I urge you to re-examine the angle you are reading this book.  Take a deep breath and see how much love you have received from the Big Tree in your lives--your parents, your friends, your Creator.

"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!",TRUE

"This is the perfect story to read when you have a few hours free and you just want to dream away and relax for a little while. Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.

Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!

Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.

I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.

These dolls have extremely small parts including hands and arms that have to be detached to undress/redress them.  Their limbs can be fragile as well and are easily snapped at the joints if they are played with too roughly.

Past that, I have nothing but praise for these highly detailed beauties!  I love the accessories they come with including highly detailed shoes, purses, jewelry, and clothing.  Their faces are gorgeous, and with the diaries and info on the boxes kids can really get to know the doll and her personality.

"This book contains 90% very accurate descriptions of characters and personality of the 12 chinese signs x the 12 western signs. I got this book many years ago, and it is accurate when I read her readings for my father, sisters and friends. I would say I find her description to be 90% accurate, I think the 10% deviation may be factoring in environmental influence (eg. if she says this person likes to dress up or vain, but sometimes if the person is brought up in a family or culture that doesn't support that, or if the person is not physically attractive, they may do the reverse from low self-esteem etc). But nonetheless, her description of people's personality and character is usually very spot on.

I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.  I have a very tough chew toy and this is my second one.  It was very well made and was easy to put together.  I would recommend this for a dog who has a lot of loose hair or loose skin.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a large dog.

"I was gifted an ARC of this boxset from Tasha Black,
also ARC of ""An Impossible Gift"" from Cristina Rayne,
as well as an ARC of ""Wish upon a star"" from Elsa Jade, in exchange for an honest review.

I'm loving this boxset so far, it has some authors I already follow & some new authors being introduced to me. Once I have read a book within, I'll add my reveiw for it.

The Clockwork Dragon by Tasha Black....
I FLOVE Tasha's ""Curse of the Alpha"" & ""Fate of the Alpha"" series & to learn that 'The Clockwork Dragon' is set at Tarker's Hollow.... made me do the happy dance. I was instantly sucked back into the lives of the citizens of Tarkers Hollow & I LOVED it!! Although it's centered around the Magical side of the community of Tarker's Hollow & not the wolves, you still get a scense of being there again. I was LOST in this, the story was rivetting.

An Impossible Gift by Cristina Rayne....
Oh My Goodness! That was short, fast paced & downright AWESOME! This is the first time I've read about Vamps from Cristina, usually it's shifters, but damn this story was good. Fast paced, full of action, loads of background story (you need this, believe me), a hot sexy Vamp who doesn't sparkle, all wrapped into a story about healing.

Wish upon a Star by Elsa Jade....
I am currently HOOKED on Elsa's ""Wolves of Angels Rest"" series, the minute one arrives on my kindle app, I'm devouring it quickly. 'Wish upon a Star' is a part of this series & what a Christmas story it was. It had me gripped from the very start, til the end... & just like the rest of the series, I devoured it & I wanted it to be longer.",TRUE

"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today.",TRUE

"At first I was shaky about whether or not I would continue reading this. It was long and full of emotion. As I kept turning pages I found myself more and more in love. V.L. Brock doesn't disappoint! If you ever feel like a story lacks description and detail then you need to read Impulses.

Samantha and Hayden are both shattered souls that wind up together. Their journey to get there is long, sad, and wonderful. Sam is beginning what she thinks is another temp but when she meets her boss, she cannot ignore the feelings that stir.

Hayden feels it too but his past haunts him and he's not sure if he can relive that. One steamy time together and they are hooked to each other. Forever bound.

While the journey isn't easy it's worth the wait. Impulses shows you what can happen when you just dive in and see where the road takes you. I am very impressed and will definitely add more of Brock to my collection.",TRUE

"Pros
-Easy installation, setup guide is well written and easy to follow
-8,000 square feet WiFi Coverage
-Easy to reach on/off switch, it is nice not to have to unplug a device just to cycle power
-Wireless Client Isolation, WiFi users can be protected from each other
-Built in Intrusion detection system
-Multiple WiFi amplifiers to make sure you get a strong signal
-Can manage up to 7 additional access points
-Can be used as a Router or an access point
-2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz WiFi
-Includes a magnetic mounting plate and standard mounting clips

 Cons

-Only has one LAN port, sure you can get a small gigabyte switch for cheap, but that is one more thing to plug in.
-Includes many advances features not needed by the average user which can be intimidating, you are paying for all these features so if you do not need them this might not be the right device for you.
-expensive

Thoughts

Not having at least 4 LAN ports is a big negative for me given the price tag, but I think I might be able to overlook that given the powerful processor and increased range it provides. This is clearly a business class device that is packed with advanced features. If is worth the money, but is more than most people need.",TRUE
"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

All I can say is, it works great. No drops, strong signal even outside. For me this was a great purchase. On my Vista laptop I did not have to install any software it used the Windows software and was a turnkey fix.",TRUE

They are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full set into the container.

They are not as sturdy as I thought they would be, but they will not break if I get too much use out of them.

I would not recommend them.I ordered these to help with my baking that needed some baking powder in it.  I love the color and the color is perfect.  The only issue is that I only used one of the top caps.  I wish I had purchased the other one for my bed.  I wish the top caps had a little bit more space to hold the top of the baking.  I will probably buy a different one.  They are also great for making cookies or cookies that I don't need to bake in the oven.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the freezer.  These work great for that.This is a good quality and works well. It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. The only thing I am a little concerned about is the size of the cover. I put it on my countertop, and it's way too small for the little pillows. I think this is a good size for the room. It would be perfect for the kitchen, but not for the bedroom.",FALSE
"Stefan and Claire are truly engaging characters and their emotions are honest and raw. The turmoil and conflict which confronts and divides them results from human trauma which could threaten the strongest relationship.

"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.",TRUE

"I wanted to revitalize my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review.",TRUE

"The second book in the Asylums for Magical Threats series is mesmerizing paranormal romance that takes the reader on an adventure.  Fighting to free elemental magic users, Camilla Melini is on a mission to find one of the legendary Four Talents. Marco Alvarez is sent to Mexico with two goals  to watch Cams back and to investigate a series of arson fires. Despite their differences they will have to work together to save their colleagues and to keep the Talent from falling into the wrong hands.

This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.  The author uses well written scenes and events to inspire vivid images that capture the imagination.  Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.

The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes. The bad guys in this series really inspire outrage and anger, only thing is there are so many plots and conflicts going on, the reader not really sure which ones are the bad guys, which of course keeps things real interesting.

Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.

The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV.

This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.

"Michael Crichton continues to explore the front edge of speculative fiction in Next, which reads like slices of life turned upside down by the availability of genetic engineering. Crichton explores many facets in parallel stories, bringing in a cast of dozens of characters--many of whom aren't burdened with ethical compass or morals to object to the growing invasiveness of advances, disregarding the physical dangers, and setting perilous precedents that could impact all life on the planet.

Next reads as a morality tale, where virtually every turn is for the worse. Vignettes interplay and rush toward a climax that puts characters on the same page, even if they seem to be thrown together for the convenience of tying loose plot lines. But the real story is a plot of themes. What are the consequences of manipulating complex systems of which man has the slightest knowledge? Just because it's possible, do we have the right to play God in the creative process? Can we foretell the results in emergent research that identifies a single variable in a chain of processes that interact in ways we've barely begun to comprehend? Crichton lays out a case for caution, without turning the book into a pulpit.

The stories in Next were compelling examples looking into the abuses of science. Although stories of talking animals (an African Gray parrot, a foul-mouthed multi-lingual orangutan, and a humanpanzee adopted into family life) were reminders that we're reading fiction, even if several of the story lines borrow from actual cases of genetic precedent. Next shows a causality of legal challenges and life implications of ignoring the dangers of unbridled creative power.",TRUE

"$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

"I've had this one on my TBR list for a while and when it went on sale for 99 cents it was time to one click and read. The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

Living in southern Arizona hats are a must if you are outdoors. It is hot and we have over 300 days of full sun. I own a tone of hats of all shapes and sizes. I was looking for a lighter weight hat I could wear under my bicycle helmet and for other sport activities. I have a mountain hardware hat that works well but does not have an adjustable strap to cinch it down tighter and the brim is smaller than this one. This hat works well to fill the gap for me. The material is definitely light weight without having a fragile too thin feel and the brim is full sized. The adjustable strap on the back is elastic so it has some flex to it and you can cinch it down as tight or loose as you want. One unique thing about this cap is that the adjustment strap has a clasp on it. I will attach a photo. The clasp is thin so it doesnt bother me even when worn under my bicycle helmet and if you have a pony tail you could unclip the strap and then clip it around you pony tail without having to pull it through like you are probably used to. This is the first hat I have seen with this feature. Very clever. The has is made from a synthetic material so it doesnt hold sweat or moisture and drys very quickly as a result. It has ventilation mesh on the sides to help it keep your head cool. It is not the thinnest or lightest hat I own but is close.

"It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.

"I have a soft spot for GOG because I saw it when I was very young with my parents at a Drive In (not first run, but in some late-1960s re-release).

This is, honestly, NOT some long forgotten great SF treasure. This is not War Of The Worlds, or Time Machine, or Day The Earth Stood Still, or The Thing, or Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-- great films all.

GOG is a second- or even third-rate SF B-picture. It's almost one step away from being a MST3K parody. ( I haven't checked, maybe MST3K actually did parody it).

There's a lot of talk and not much action. The characters are all cardboard. The scriptwriters force the actors to deliver looooooong monolog lectures, 'explaining' nonexistent pseudo-science to an audience they must have thought were imbeciles. The dialog is stilted and chunky and amateurish.

And the zero-budget 'special effects' are GOG and MAGOG, a couple of aluminum-foil-covered-cardboard-box chest-height ""robots"" that don't even move an inch for most of their brief time onscreen.

I mean, this is a painfully awful little film.

I would never spend money to own a copy. But if you're in a nostalgic (and very forgiving, and MST3K-ish) mood, by all means see this on Instant Prime Streaming.
Feel free to jeer and boo at times, and enjoy the cheesy no-budget unintended campiness that is GOG.

Imagine yourself around 1964 parked in a grassy Drive-In with the speaker hung on your car window, surrounded by trucks and cars with tail fins, and a 35-cent deluxe bucket of popcorn with extra butter. And enjoy.

"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.

"This movie got SMACKED TO THE HILT by the critics - usually a sign that a movie is good.

In fact, it is not an 'amazing' movie - don't expect a masterpiece - but it is not bad by any way of measurement. Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off as predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) comes across as a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate has an up-market jobs, a lot of the problems she faces are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, boss calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleagues and the like.

Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film tries to mock stay-at-home mothers; as if stereotyping stay-at-home mothers will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, as Kate deals with a flirtatious but supportive superior.

You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate finds herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other characters are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it was only ever meant to be comical.",TRUE

I have a pair of chucks that I bought a few years ago that have been replaced by a 10.5, and these are still a great buy.  They fit well, they are very soft, and they are so comfortable that I have never had them break, and I wear them all the time.

My granddaughter does not let the bus out of her site.  I would recommend the Calico Critters for all toddlers.  I started her with them at 2 and she is five now and still plays with all of them.  The house and all the stores you can get makes a great little town for them.,TRUE
"V. is like some weird, dark fantasy, with a lot of twists and turns. I was just blown away by the way the author explained how the characters were different from each other, and how it was possible to change in the same way. I loved the way the author wrote the descriptions, and the way she used the same descriptive elements in the different stories. I loved how she kept the focus on the main characters, and kept it fresh.

The story itself was very well done, with the art style and the setting. I liked the fact that it was not just a fantasy story, but a true real life",FALSE

"I've read all of James' books on the Beatles, so was interested to see what he had to say about the Bee Gees. And, I wasn't disappointed. Because I didn't follow the Bee Gees as closely as I did the Beatles, I didn't really know that much about their history or much of their music. One thing I like about all of James' books, including this one, is the interesting tidbits of history that he includes - not only about the music and the bands, but about the time period in which they became popular.",TRUE

"There and Now - Engaging, an entertaining story about a small town in the middle of nowhere, and a two-story apartment building, both with its own mysterious shadows. The reader is entranced by the juxtaposition of life in this small town with the rich and famous. The book is a fast read with a great amount of entertainment.I loved this book. It has great twists and turns. This book is a must read for any young adult. It's very easy to understand and understand the text. You won't be disappointed.I'm not sure how I feel about this book.  I am a sucker for suspense and it's hard to read a book that is so full of surprises and twists.  However, I loved this book and was looking forward to it all.  I wish I had the book sooner.  I'm not a fan of the idea of the author being so powerful that she has to hide behind a cover.  I'm not a fan of the author getting away with it, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy it.  I have read every book by Ms. Kleypas that I have read and loved.  I have to admit that I was disappointed with this one.  It was a bit predictable and not very gripping.

"I'm a plus size woman (24/26 in pants, 3X in shirts), but only C cup breasts. It's hard to find lingerie that fits the way I want. I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much. I would recommend it overall.",TRUE

However, the three light wings on the sides are adjustable, and provide an excellent area light suitable for camping or working on my vehicle after dark.  I think we will carry this in out RV.  By the way, I spent ten minutes rapidly switching both switches in an attempt to duplicate the lock up problem others have reported, but it worked perfectly.
