I had a lot of fun with this book and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next one.

3.5 Stars

I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This is the second book in the series and I love it! I love the characters and the plot! The two main characters are a perfect combination of fun and sexy. I loved the way the author used the language of romance and the fact that the author did a great job of making it work. The story flowed nicely and kept my interest! I am looking forward to reading more by this author. I hope there is more to come in the series!If you are looking for a little steamy fun, this is for you.

This is a cute story of two people who have been separated in love.

A few things that I liked about the story:

It's short and easy to read.

The characters are well developed.

I liked the story line.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a light read.

I have a problem with the length.

The story is told in one sitting.

The ending is a little long.",FALSE

I have to get the lid off the pot and take the pot to the kitchen for cleaning. It is not very easy to clean.

But it has some issues.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two.",TRUE

"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

"The Ontario Gen II SP-50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel. It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50.

I'd go with the RTAK II all things considered.",TRUE

"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands.",TRUE

"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",TRUE

"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.

It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with.

"The only thing being machine-gunned by the Americans was a lot of soldiers in the field. I had to read a book by the author, ""War Is Not a Good War"" and it was in good shape.

The book is great, but I think the author is putting too much emphasis on the very first part of the book. It is not a great book, but it is worth reading.

"I agree with Vosper's ideas. They are incredibly radical, and yet, at this point in my spiritual journey, they make clear and logical sense. I feel saddened by the vitriol that can result from anyone either agreeing or disagreeing with these ideas. Although I have left theism behind, it has not been without struggle or deep sadness. My former beliefs gave me so much comfort and joy, and a sense of purpose, all of which have now been torn from me. Therefore, I don't condemn or rail against those who still cling to them fiercely. I understand their anger against these ideas - an anger born of fear bordering on panic. And I don't want to be so smugly certain I am right now, as I was so smugly certain I was right when I was a fundamentalist literalist Christian. I have gained much, but may have lost even more.

"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statements of facts introduced into this book are true.  Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.

Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.

Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it.

"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

"I've had them all. Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

"The bar does not fit into the two ends snuggly.  This is I can live with since this is the only bar whose depth fits into the space I have available in my bathroom for a towel bar.  However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now.",TRUE

"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat.",TRUE

"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse. I have no issues with video quality, with the exception of some bumpy Netflix experiences, but that's not a Roku issue.  I have convinced a few of my non-sports viewing friends to get rid of their cable completely and just use Roku.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus are my favorite channels, but I explore the other options every once in a while.

"I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.
It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).
I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.
Little akward to fold.  The front wheels need to be lined up to fit inside the back wheels.  If one forces, I could see where they could be damaged.

"WOWSER

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope. Whichever way she managed to get all those pieces back together, my hat goes off to her as it would have been oh so easy to have departed in other ways.",TRUE

"If you're a parent/grandparent with a youngster just discovering the ""Cars"" movies, I can tell you that my husband and I have had a blast collecting these small, 1:55 scale Mattel models for our grandsons.  You definitely need a strategy if you plan to collect, since their are just SO many of them.  Hard enough trying to just figure out who all of the characters are!

Giuseppi Motorosi is the Italian-speaking pit crew chief for Lightning McQueen's primary rival, Francesco Bernoulli, in the Cars 2 sequel, both of them sporting the colors of the Italian flag, and they were actually sold together in a 2-pack last year (if you're just starting to collect, might want to check the 2-pack out in case it saves you.)  According to the cute little bios they put out on the characters, Giuseppi is designed as a 1966/69 Alpha Romeo Duetto, a former racer himself until he had a major accident at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track on the Curva Parabolica (the final challenge of the race), and has now teamed up with Formula Race champ Francesco.  This - as with all of these little models - is very durable and nicely detailed... just be careful - if you get one of the crew chiefs, your youngster's bound to want them all!

This year Giuseppi is part of the 9-piece WGP Pit Crew collection, along with Alex Machino, Max Schnell's pitty (be careful about adding the racers' little forklift pitty characters too... there's a bunch of them!), Otto Bonn, Austin Littleton, and 2-packs of Manual Maniez/Bruno Motoreau and Jeff Gorvette's Pitty/John Lassetire.",TRUE

Book 2 of the series starts 3 months after the first book ended. Jenna and her five year old daughter are trying to live a normal life away from Lilly's father who happens to be a crime boss of the London mob. Jenna and Lilly barely escaped death at her father's Cornwall property. So Jenna wants to stay away from Farrell Black. However the people who want to kill her are because her father found out a shady lab was developing a bioweapon. Jenna discovers she and Lilly are far from safe and turns to Farrell to help. But Jenna and Farrell realize they must stop this evil group that is willing to kill and threaten. This story becomes extremely exciting as Jenna and Farrell travel from Italy to England to Amsterdam to Germany trying to stay ahead of the murderous group. The book is sit on the edge of your seat exciting but also advances the loving and sensual relationship of ore hero and heroine. The ending makes you want book three immediately but June is the last installment. I highly recommend this series.,TRUE

"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.

"Reading through the different reviews here, you'd think this guy were Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and Wolfgang Mozart rolled into one.  Let me think of the simplest way to say this:  he's not.
The storyline was original, that's for sure.  And his emotion is raw.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of something - although what exactly that is (misdirected youth?  the refusal to accept that people usually _earn_ money?) is sometimes muddled.
But the delivery is poor.  I found it cutesy and contrived.  He relies on the same old gag structure again and again - that one line delivered at the very end to set the last three pages' worth of diatribe on its ear:  ""You just missed your exit"".  ""The wallet was there the whole time.""  and so on.  Add that to the fact that the timeline was impossible to follow, and that the technique of alternating paragraphs between two different time periods does not a gifted writer make, and this presentation had serious flaws.
Unrestrained by literary devices such as plot, he goes on to present a convoluted ""three years [I think it was three years although time flow was truly warped] in the life of"" stream-or-consciousness (whoops I meant ""stream OF consciousness"") story of his recent life.
What's he getting at?  Is he misdirected?  Uninspired?  Lazy?  All of the above?  Am I supposed to admire this?  Is this the role-model of the 21st century?  For the story to be potent, I think it needed a sharper edge.",TRUE

"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other.",TRUE

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.

I found it extremely practical, far more than other books I bought.  It corresponds and doesn't conflict with the manners and socialization classes we are taking for puppy training.  The progression of skills is very logical, allowing you to train using logical building blocks.  Getting the first series of lessons taught to puppy leads you in a logical sequence to the next chapter.  There is also a great chapter on how to resolve problems such as barking, house training, and all the nusiance behaviors (growling, jumping on your bed, etc).

"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power.",TRUE

First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.",TRUE

"Indestructible is a dystopian fantasy that grabs a hold of you, thrusts you into a manic world of action and danger, and doesn't let go. And the moments where you've been given a chance to let your heart slow down don't ever last too long before you're thrown back into the action again.

Leah is a girl who loses everything when an energy blast rips through her town. Now taken in by a band of folks called Pyros, she comes to find out the truth about who she is and what she can do, as well as whom to trust and whom not to.

There is a lot of mythological weaving in this story, which I quite enjoyed. Adams does a nice job of simultaneously answering questions that pop up during Leah's journey and adding new questions as a result of those answers. I found myself wanting to discover exactly what happened in the past to bring this cast of characters to this point.

"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters.",TRUE

"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change.",TRUE

Next I lift and place his back legs, one at a time, into the sack, and after that I gently press on his rump to get him to sit down inside it. Finally I zip him up and lift him up to settle him down into the bag. Putting it in myself is the trickiest part, but I've gotten the hang of it after using it so much. I find it actually pretty comfortable to wear. It helps to cinch the straps and being the bag high up on my back.

For the fit, my boy is a 15 pound miniature poodle, long and lanky for his weight. I measured him according to the manufacturer's instructions, and his length was 17 inches, exactly on the borderline between small and medium. So I got a medium, and while it is roomy it doesn't seem too large. I haven't gotten the booster pad.

In summary, I recommend this sack highly!  It works so well for us and I am so grateful to this company for making such a high quality product.",TRUE

I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.

I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to use bluetooth headphones for listening to music or videos. Great. I like that the cradle is very convenient for holding your tablet when you're doing work. I'm not sure why the design of the cradle has such a long strap, but it's a nice feature. It makes it easier to work around while driving and to keep your tablet upright when you're driving. I've had no problems with this product so far, but I'd be surprised if I never use it.

"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

Mr. & Mrs. no relationships. They have an instant attraction but do not want to be involved with each other because of their friends. They think it will just complicate a already complicated situation with Natasha & Felix, but their chemistry is too strong and situations too intense to break the bond they have. Instead it turns it from friends to lovers. The desire for each other becomes too much and they change their relationship! I absolutely love these two as a couple.

After buying other furniture I was concerned this too would turn out to be built with kittens in mind instead of adult cats, but happily it is perfect for not only kittens, but adults too.  My big 18 lb cat often enjoys resting on top on it as well as inside it and using it to sharpen his claws, even my clawless kitty (I found her that way) enjoys using it to sharpen her non-existent claws.  This was definitely money well spent.  It's well built well and fits large as well as heavy cats, and it's neutral color scheme blends in well with my other furniture.",TRUE
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had to laugh at the antics of the main character, Aiden, to woo Katie over. He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.

Overall I enjoyed this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series to see how the other characters fared.",TRUE

"First of all, you cannot compare ANY books to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it as if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other authors to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either.
With that said, this book tells a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that builds between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read parts of this book and I did get tears in my eyes during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he has for Lisa.
The story begins when Lisa goes back in time, she meets Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story goes on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she knows no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story takes you by suprise. I was not expecting an ending like that, but it was a pleasent ending none the less.
I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys time travel/romance stories. You just CANNOT compare it to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. But Karen Marie Moning does deserve an applaud for this story.",TRUE

"For sports fans, some of the best bits & more from the tv & radio show that is on a bit early if you're unemployed. Mike Greenberg takes charge most of the time. Mike Golic is now well into his second career as co-anchor of the show. He was a defensive lineman in the NFL for nine years. He seems chronically grumpy mainly because he has to to put up with ""nancy boy"" Mike Greenberg. For his next career Greenie wants to be baseball commissioner. He has some new rules for the game that make sense: more day games & bring back double headers which would in turn shorten the season so they wouldn't have to play outside in November in Minneapolis or New York or  Boston. Some make no sense. No soup will be served in any ball park. Bring back the troughs in the men's rooms, like in Wrigley field. Ah, tradition. They talk about the unwritten rules of baseball. They are moronic, numerous & as old as the game. I love them & woe be to the player that breaks them. Other sports are covered too. The ""sheets of integrity"" for ""March Madness"" college basketball is classic. Golic has no integrity when it comes picking his 64 teams. They have an annual wager that is a highlight & has included in the past Greenie milking a cow on live & Golic getting his rather hairy body waxed.

One day, after running a memory test for 8 hours, the server refused to boot.  After letting it sit for 8 hours, it booted just fine.  I immediately suspected a heat issue.

I purchased these coolers because they were active air movers versus just passive metal coolers. (and the price was right)

They've worked perfectly.  My server has not crashed once since I installed them!!  It runs much faster, and I've not noticed an increase in noise.

Prior to installing them, the chips were extremely hot to the touch after a memory test.  Today with the Air Coolers, they barely luke warm.

"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.

"The design of this faucet is Transitional bordering on Contemporary. The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.  The pull down is very easy to use and works better than having a separate sprayer.  The faucet is easy to clean and keep cleaned as well.  The installation was very easy and the instructions were good but not great.  I have installed a few faucets so I had a working understanding of what I was doing.  Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.  Once the old faucet was removed the total installation time was less than a 1/2 hour.  The handle can be installed to the left or the right based on your desire.

"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected.  Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.

"I purchased 2 bras....this one and the Bali Women's Smooth U Front Close Bra.  I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.

"I searched all the blogs but NO ONE could tell me how to hang this type of derailleur on a cheap bike...

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is..

"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

"Ryder is still grieving the wife he loved and lost more than 4 years ago, but finds himself drawn to his best friend Tess in deeper ways; they are in love with each other, but don't want to risk ruining their friendship.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary.

"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar.

Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag.

I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.,TRUE

"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:

"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product.

"This rug is awesome. It is so comfortable and the quality is great. It was delivered on a stormy day and survived transport. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen.",TRUE

"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",TRUE

First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately.

"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless.",TRUE

"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is.",TRUE

It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.

Daryl is a polar bear shifter in the Tennessee Honey band. He is older then the reat and has felt alone for sometime. While taking a dip, he meets Matt who happens to see him in his polar bear form. Matt's dad is a grizzly shifter and not the best person (even though Matt has been sheltered from this information). When Daryl meets Matt's mom Alison, there is a connection between them two of them. Alison doesn't want to act on it due to her ex and believes Mat should come first. Matt is getting to the age of shifting, so Alison ask Daryl to talk with Matt. During this time, everyone becomes closer including Daryl and Alison.

Can Alison over come her fears of losing Matt? Is Daryl willing to take a chance and stay with them?

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",TRUE

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",TRUE

Communication is a lot needed to understand each other, too, it is a give and take relationship. We should learn to listen and connect with them and even become a child if needed, that way we will be able to understand them. Be fun and creative! I highly recommend this book!",TRUE
"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft.",TRUE

Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the flashing rings, the seller or with amazon, except for as a customer.",TRUE

It definitely was trying to show that we are many different people, and we show different ""faces"" depending on who we are dealing with throughout our lives.

I didn't might the drums so much but the creepy sexual undertones in an Ingmar Bergman style along with the 40's esc dramatic - and I might add ""irritating"" music. The switching to creepy black, and white; as well as the image of spiders also reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's style of cinematography. The scenes in which the characters didn't ""turn the damn lights on"" kind of bugged me. Again, the Director may have intentionally done this to show that sometimes we ourselves are not even aware of these different layers within our personality's.

"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from.

"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared.

"Got this as our older router/wireless AP was having difficulty with having XP and Win7 machines connected at the same time. This one has been great for all devices, solid signal strength about 30 feet beyond the perimeter of the house (brick). Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue. But sometimes it is just the router (have tested directly from the modem) and both wireless and wired connections all fail. Haven't tried a firmware update yet as honestly... we have just gotten used to having to power cycle it occasionally and it is a pretty quick fix.",TRUE

This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner.",TRUE

"I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.

I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed. I was able to put it together by myself in about 45 minutes.

"Warning- some spoilers inside:
Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better.
Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry.
And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing.
The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.
I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three.",TRUE

"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.

"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned.",TRUE

The story of how 300 years old people are reanimated after being exposed to the sun and the other elements.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is based on a novel by the late Robert Burns.  The film was filmed in the 1980s and is a 2 hour documentary on the history of the universe.  The DVD features interviews with the film making crew and the crew members.  The movie is a continuation of the original film by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is about the creation of the universe.  This is the first time I have seen this film.  It is definitely a must see for fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.This was a great movie and the acting was good. I loved it and the story was good,FALSE
"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time.",TRUE

"I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.",TRUE

"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.",TRUE

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",TRUE

"Shortly after starting to use this product I developed my first ever case of Pink Eye. The doctor verified that it was not a viral or bacterial infection.

"The construction of this Mag-Lite Solitaire is really quite good.  It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.",TRUE

"Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection.

"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product.

"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build.",TRUE
"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",TRUE

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them. This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget. This is a great book.",FALSE

I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it.",TRUE

"REVIEW REFERENCES the ""Wireless"" Unit:

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

In this story there are quite a few dark moments that have you holding your breath and praying and hoping for the best. What I loved about this story is that it provides you with the past and present time so you can fully understand what happened in Teagans life that got her to that moment. You start to understand Teagan more, or at least I did.

I thought this story was very well done. I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was.

This model is different than the Wembley model. On the Wembley model only the thin bar rotates up and you can easily slide the rolls on and off--but I found that the bar rattles a bit . On this model the end of the bar that pivots is attached to about an inch wide segment of  the support bracket.

"Best value non smart tv on amazon. This review is of the 39 inch model. I did a lot of research and at the time this was by far the highest quality and best value at this price point and size. It's not a smart tv but most smart tv's apps are hard to use and poorly implemented besides I have an xbox and chromecast so I don't care about it being a dum TV.

Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it. A quick google search will yield settings that work well but I had to fiddle with the backlighting and black levels to get it how I thought looked best.

Sound: other reviews say sound sucks on this tv. The sound is actually quite good as long as it's not mounted to the wall. When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra ""BASS""

"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying.",TRUE

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years.

It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer.

"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR. All in all, this comes across as a cheap, uninspired knock-off of other fantasy classics and is not worth wasting one's money on. I would recommend passing on this one.",TRUE

"Anyone familiar with the Desire, Oklahoma series will recognize the cast of characters in this story -- including Dillon and Ryder. The newest addition to the town comes in the form of Alison (Ally as affectionately referred to by Ryder). Alison comes to Desire on the heels of a bad breakup from an abusive boyfriend. Similar to all the other stories in the series, Dillon and Ryder come swooping into her life completing ensconcing themselves in it while overwhelming her with their (neanderthalithic) overbearing ways and masculinity.

The story prattled along at a lumbering pace, IMHO, as Alison whined about things being ""none of your (Dillion and Ryder's) business"" (said 14 times) and spanking threats from the men (mentioned 33 times...yes...I counted). The story was highly repetitive...not only of itself but of the other stories in the series. Really the characters in these stories are interchangeable because the story lines are so consistent with one other. This series now has 8 books in it...and honestly, as a reader, I'm getting to the point where I don't care because there is nothing unique about them anymore. Desire for Three: Winning Back Jesse is actually about the characters in Desire for Three. *Scratches my head*....so now we're going back and revisiting characters? Pass!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Leah Brooke's work, I just want to see some originality come into play in her stories. As they are now...they are just meh because of near exactness of the stories and characters -- resistant females...dominant men...and they all live happily ever after.

Send a couple looking to add to their triad.......give me something different to work with.

Bradley's characters are likeable and fully human and his prose is rich. The scene toward the end of the book where the paintings are found reminded me of the scene in A.S.

"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.",TRUE

"*I was given a copy of this book as a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!",TRUE

"This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.",TRUE

"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge.",TRUE

"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

I read directions in manual just because wise thing to do. I opened the fly nut 6 or 7 times and ran it until air was out of hydraulic line. After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading reviews about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentlemen on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant  wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hours splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chips to stick to it. And it helps to prevent screeching sounds.

"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.",TRUE

"For the price, these treat boxes are excellent.  The 6"" tall measurement is from the base to the top of the handles when they are assembled.  In terms of storage space, the interior dimensions once assembled can accommodate items about 6"" long, 3"" wide, and 3-4"" tall.  Like most cheap mass-produced paper goods, there are some small defects on some individual pieces (some cuts aren't clean, some stick together, etc.),  If you are a perfectionist who will be bothered by these slight defects, you should consider ordering a 10% overrun.  Mine were going to kids, so I didn't care.  I would not use these for heavy items, but they were great for kids party favors.",TRUE
"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.",TRUE

While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect.

"(Wife): Basic Paw Patroller. You must attach stickers yourself. There are also 1-2 other things you must attach / get in place before letting a kid play with this one. So, I unpackaged the thing and prepped it before giving it to our daughter for Christmas. Comes with Ryder figure and ATV. The ATV is pretty sturdy and good on carpet. But, Ryder's legs are rather fragile. The Patroller trailer section only holds THREE (3) medium-sized vehicles while closed. BUT, you CAN stuff an entire set of Paw Patrol figurines inside the Paw Patroller when closed IF you use figurines, racers and/or an appropriate combination of figurines and mid-sized vehicles. The cab of the truck holds 4-5 figurines. (Five if you really pack 'em in, possibly plus 1-2 removable packs. )

Here's what we stuff in our Patroller (while still being able to close it):

Two medium-sized vehicles with riding figures (Ryder & ATV, and Everest & snowmobile);
Two small racers (Chase and Zuma);
Two figurines plus their detachable packs (Skye and Rocky);
Two figurines with spring-action packs (Robodog and Tracker); and
Two figurines with other features (Rubble and Marshall). Reasonably sturdy Paw Patroller. Makes noise. Comes with battery. Rather large. Opens to reveal a second floor. Not bad for transporting or storing all Paw Patrol figures / vehicles IF you plan ahead. Our daughter enjoyed it for Christmas.",TRUE

"This CPU was too fast.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not.",TRUE

"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",TRUE

"Intensity is very special book, since its story is so different than any other and so damn unpredictable!

Every twist and every turn the story takes is unexpected and brilliantly developed. The characters take us in one spectacular ride and we love every second of it!

I couldn't put it down!!

Serena is such a lovely character! She has a good heart, but she isn't naive or crying her heart out over men. She is a good and loyal friend. She isn't fearless; she has fears that she deal with every single day. She is a good girl, but isn't judgemental regarding others who arent.

Linc is well..a good man / alpha male. He has this Youre mine - No one touches you thing, but he isn't overbearing. He protects with elegance, should I say. Hes quite the gentleman for an alpha male, too.

I have to say that everyone should have one Serena as a friend and definitely a Linc as a man!

Its beautifully written and everything fits perfectly!!

Intensity is a great book and I loved it!

I strongly recommend it!!

However, I would like to say that its the FIRST BOOK!! The story continues to the next book or books.

Personally, I strongly dislike when I don't know this fact before I read the book. I don't have an issue if its a 2 book story or a trilogy. But I do want to know beforehand. Unfortunately, it does not happen.

In conclusion, Intensity is a great book that you MUST READ!!

So, Intensity receives 5 Huge Sparkling Golden Stars!!",TRUE

"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.",TRUE

"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!

Get this set and let Bette Davis show what great acting is.",TRUE

He assembles 11 men to help him and they are played by such crowd-pleasers as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, and Elliott Gould.  The movie is fun, slick and full of high-tech and low-tech gimmicks which help Ocean's 11 gain access to the casinos.  My biggest complaint is that Julia Roberts is miscast and underutilized as the trophy wife/girlfriend of the two adversaries.  However, if you can put that aside, Ocean's 11 offers an enjoyable evening of entertainment.",TRUE

The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.

"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or

"Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.

"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

"Funny, I just sold a Bulova Precisionist chronograph (9B175) this past week, and then ended up getting this one!  The other Bulova was a bit too large, heavy, and chunky for my tastes.  This one, however, is very nicely done!!

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

All in all, this is a fine watch for $200+ dollars!!  I'm happy to add it to my collection.",TRUE

"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others.",TRUE

"This movie is wonderfully simple and sincere in presenting its message. The story is based on the life of Patrick ""Tyler"" Doherty. It presents the question ""Why God?"" Here is an upright church-going family, where firstly the father and main bread winner dies unexpectedly, and then the younger of two brothers is diagnosed with a rare breed of brain cancer, that is quite aggressive.

Most Christians believe in divine healing, but what is the response supposed to be when a much needed healing does not take place in the life of a young innocent boy? This is the scenario that is presented. Each member of the family suffers from the pressure of this situation and Tyler's grandmother steps in as a source of help and encouragement.

Tyler keeps his faith and starts writing his letters to God in order to keep his perspective of things and those around him. In an apparent answer to one of these letters, a new postman shows up and befriends the family. He has his own family challenges, but Tyler's resolve and determination motivates him not up give up on trying to solve his own personal problems.

This film is very moving emotionally, it will make most people cry and will keep you hoping and believing. The message rings true to the end, hold on to Jesus no matter the outcome.",TRUE

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written.

"""Ape House"" is a light read that attempts to open the animal world to us by bringing the Bonobos Apes to life in an original way.

This is a story about a family of Bonobos, their caretaker scientist Isabel Duncan and a down to earth reporter John Thigpen. I will cover the plotting in a few words, it begins with the primate language laboratory being bombed and Isabel left badly injured, severe enough to end up in the trauma ward of the closest hospital. The Bonobos fall into the hands of a porn producer and are locked up in a house with cameras broadcasting their every move on cable television. Reporter John Thigpen covers the story while his personal life is on a down turn, his home life it is about to take a drastic change. The plotting gets meatier when Isabel is released from hospital and teams up with John to find out who targeted the laboratory, for what reason and what has happened to her family of apes.

The story explores in a far-fetched semi captivating manner, the issue of animal rights from the point of view of activists, scientists and the public. The plot takes a meandering course with a bit of action here and there mostly done by the humans, there are also subtle references to sexual activities amongst the apes and their unique methods of communication. I found this part satire and part morality driven tale was presented to us by a cast of lackluster and easily forgotten characters, maybe if the Bonobos had been given a greater role it would have left a more lasting impression. Unfortunately the book started strong just to peter out by the end, I was disappointed when the tale did not capture the apes' behaviour, gestures and emotions in a more detailed fashion.

Although the story was not what I had anticipated, I nevertheless enjoyed the change.",TRUE

This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.,TRUE

"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character.",TRUE
"First: I don't like to give anything away about the stories.

The Bombay's are a family of assassins and have been for the past 4000 yrs or so. If you are a blood relative, then you will become an assassin or die. If you marry into the family, male or female, you must change your last name to Bombay.  The children are all named after countries, states, cities, etc. The cousins that we read about are fun and funny.  Despite being assassins, they live normal lives, just like the rest of us, except for the rather large trust funds that each has.  The assassin business has paid well over the years.  They find themselves in precarious situations, and the fun begins. Despite the sometimes poor editing, I enjoy these books a lot. I tend to pick them up and read the next when I need a good laugh.",TRUE
"At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned.",TRUE

"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then picks a question card from the pile and reads it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All players start with 10 points each and would bet 1-3 points based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the questions are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidates and how the players would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidates and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on.

Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the questions presented tend to be adult only (sex related). As such, I'm seriously doubt that the age 14 and up rating from the manufacturer is appropriate. I would personally remove those questions before passing it to my teenager when he has his friends over. The game comes with everything you'll need such as a dry erase board and pen for writing the five candidates down, 1-2 point chips for betting and spinners for selecting your own vote.",TRUE

"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read that kept me interested. I couldn't help feeling for what Paige went through as a kid and how it shaped her life and her families. It truly shows how when one person in a family is ill, it affects everyone.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Of course at times I wasn't always a fan of Jake's attitude, but as the book progressed he got better. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this enjoyable series.

"Similar issue to another recent reviewer.  The screen I received did not have LP133WF2 anywhere on it, except for a printed sticker on the cardboard packing.  Instead, the labels on the screen itself said N133HSE-EA3.  The port on this particular screen is on the opposite side from the cable and the OEM screen.  The cable is too short to reach to the opposite side, and after removing the bottom cover, I discovered you can't even move the cable to the other side as the port on the motherboard is on the same side as the OEM screen.

"The best part of this scene is the cannon that swivels on the turret and the Tauntaun.  Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for $40+ the other portions of the scene.  A pretty good value.  On it's own this scene can clearly shows a solid Hoth scene-but is by no means huge.

As part of a larger Hoth scene, this becomes essential.  I have added it to the Limited Edition Echo Base 7879, Hoth Wampa Cave 8089, Hoth Rebel Base 7666 one additional Echo Base, two Motorized At-At's (10178), other dark gray and white misc pieces AND white dog toy stuffing for quite the display.

Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down.

"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.",TRUE

"These sorts novels rest a lot on believable characters. The problem with Florida novels is that real living characters in Florida often eclipse any fictional characters for stupidity, corruption and evil intent. This is the state that attracts serial killers, Koran burning ministers, scammers and con artists, and whose main reputation in other states for monumental zaniness. Here Randy Wayne White has created a sane grounded, and admirable character. Most importantly he doesn't make her a superwomen, kung fu warrior. She's brave and tough and smart, but she makes mistakes in a dangerous situation that are both human and suspenseful. The sort that anyone placed in a highly stressful situation would make. My complaint about a lot of writers in this genre is their characters are too masterful and unbelievable and you can lose interest in them easily. The second part that I liked about this is its a tightly plotted ""little"" story that deals with evil and takes us on a little journey through west florida and the thousand islands. And that too makes it very readable. The challenge for Randy White is that of a male trying to write in the first person about a female. I think it's extremely difficult to do. And I think the author does a good job of this. But not quite. Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It could be that as a fan I could not forget the male Doc of his other novels, and I had the odd sensation of the marine biologist sort of springing out in drag sometimes. I'm pretty much convinced though that this is more my fault than the authors. If you are a fan read this one. It's even better if you are new to his fiction. It's great, and a new start, for White. I think Hanna, as a fishing guide, and cracker descendent, will be able to go places that the good Doctor can't quite find.",TRUE

"I could sense the author's presence in this book of short stories; I almost felt as if she were reading them to me. I believe she is highly invested in her characters.

The stories, as indicated by the book's title, are grim, dealing with issues such as mortality, helplessness, identity and revenge. The story that resonated with me the most was The Promise, which partnered innocence with malignant intent. The resolution is tragic.

The stories are arranged in segments: Short, Shorter and Shortest. For me, the Shortest stories are presented more as ideas than as full tales, and need more content. However, the ideas are solid. I think that with a little time and polish, Alisha ""Priti"" Kirpalani will be a name to watch in the future.",TRUE

"I thought that this would be more of a baseball book, as I'm a big fan of the nation's pastime. However, Babe Ruth figures into the story only tangentially as a means of helping to set the stage--Boston, as WWI is drawing to a close, and Prohibition is on its way. This book is a nice blend of fact and fiction, and the facts are more engrossing than the fiction. Boston at that time was a city in trouble, anxious to blame just about everything on the Communists, except perhaps the flu epidemic, and by the end I felt as if that had happened a couple of books ago. The family histrionics are fairly predictable, with the bad son (Connor), the good son (Danny, our hero), and the young son (Joe). Of course, Mom and Dad have their heads in the sand and think that the good son is really the bad son and vice versa. There's also Eddie, who came over on the boat from Ireland with Dad and is evil personified. Dad and Eddie are cops on the take, and Danny, also a cop, gets involved with unionizing the police force.

"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.

It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.

In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death.",TRUE
"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.",TRUE

The nearly 2-year-old loves to fiddle with the bricks and build her own little structures for the bunnies to sit on. The set is a great balance of building blocks, plus the ""extras"" of a fence piece, carrots, bowl and flowers.

We unfortunately lost the brown bunny a couple weeks ago, and never found it. After looking around on ebay, I finally used the Lego website to ask for a replacement part. Their customer service was excellent--I was on hold less than a minute and they were very proactive in helping me out.

Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray.

Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )

"Using his unique style, Vonnegut tells the galaxy about our dying planet.  He sees it as a hideous mess of robotic creatures programmed to destroy themselves, specifically through destruction by American capitalism and racism.  At times this does seem a bit cliche, but his style is anything but.  It's funny, original, and at times very personal.

The best parts of the book are when he literally draws himself into the story.  He tries to be a good God to his characters, but seems to fail as our Creator must have.  It's not as good as Slaughter House Five, but his shocking style is in strong form.

For those who want to pick up the audio version for the Vonnegut interview- don't.  In the beginning of the interview Vonnegut and his interviewer both reveal that they haven't read the book in a while, then proceed to talk about completely unrelated topics which go nowhere.

"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far.",TRUE

"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.

"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!",TRUE

"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Confidence is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that has also hopped to the top of the to buy list for me.",TRUE
"If you are interested in learning what happens at sea when boredom, monotony, ennui  and endless accounts of filler material taken from every one of the good, action packed adventures that began this series then this is the book for you. I happen to like learning what a day may have looked like at sea in that era but not to the extent that it is all that we learn about over all the pages except the last thirty when the action begins but is broken with an abrupt ending. Of course the action resumes where it left off at the beginning of the next book. In what is rapidly becoming a dissatisfying series, this is the supreme example of dissatisfaction up to this point in my opinion. As usual, I cant fault the writing but the point of this story seems to have been to sell one more book no matter the consequences of not providing an entertaining story. When I first read this series I thought every one of them was a masterpiece of naval historical work. Now that Ive been hooked by the genre, I can say many more recent writers have exceeded these last few books in story telling quality. Two that immediately come to mind are Dewey Lambdin and Jay Worrell. From the same timeframe when OBrian was writing, I value Dudley Popes work more highly. Considering my lack of memory of what the rest of the series holds I hope my opinion of these last few books is dispelled by those remaining. Like the last book, you could completely skip this one without losing anything in the overall storyline.",TRUE

"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.

( LMI)  It works exactly as advertised for filling grain, especially in fine hardwoods like those used in guitar building or refinishing. Dries fast and clear. Sands easily. Very little odor. Non toxic. Water based. Builds fast but is not a heavy tone-killing finish so it is great for acoustic or semi acoustic instruments. Remember to do small sections, because it dries fast. Other than that small caution, I can wholehearted recommend this water based finish. You can see a good demonstration video here:

"At this price this rig is a steal. Rigs are priced way too high and it's often hard to find a rig at an affordable price. Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.
-You get all the essentials.",TRUE

"What a great little movie.  I had never heard of this, but it popped up on my recommendations and got good reviews, so I gave it a try.  This so much reminded me of Donald Westlake's comic crime caper novels.  A great little story with plenty of laughs.  The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'.  Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy.  William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman.
