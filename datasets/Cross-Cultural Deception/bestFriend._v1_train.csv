" My best friend is called Karolina. We are best friends for couple of years now and I love the positive energy she has. She is a very open person, always friendly and non-judgmental. I can tell her everything and she always gives me the best advice, even if that means she has to tell me the painful truth. I know that I can call her in the middle of the night if I need help and without a doubt she will be there for me and she will help me out. For example, couple of weeks ago I was organizing a very important event for me and she was always happy to help me with organizing, cooking and photographing. We are like sisters and even when we are not able to see each other, we are always in touch via Facebook or phone.

" Me an my best friend have known each other for a while. We are on the same wavelength when it comes to comedy. We have had a relationship where we can give each other a hard time and not take it personal. Just the other day I was making fun of him for having too much grease on his forehead and he took it like a champ. That sounds like a pretty good relationship.
",TRUE
" I've known my best friend since kindegarden. WE've grown up in the same neighborhood and went to the same high school. We stayed in touch though college, though drifted a bit. Once I was back, we picked right up and we've been close ever since. I've known him for almost 30 years!

" My friendship with my best friend is quite good, I think.  Like most people who spend a lot of time together, we do have some occasional problems, but I think part of what makes our relationship great is that we're able to get over most sorts of issues and appreciate one another in the end.  We also have a lot of common interests and are happy to defer to the other person in order to make them happy, if necessary (though that's hardly necessary).  I think ultimately, we just get along really well and enjoy doing whatever together, even if it's not the most fun thing in the world.  For instance, I remember once it was late at night and we were both really tired and out of our minds, and we just had a really good conversation that lasted ages.  Neither of us had anything in particular to say or do, but we were able to just talk and enjoy the company of one another without any awkwardness or pretense.
",TRUE

" She has been there for me when I was depressed and wanted to give up on myself. A very supportive person. Very funny, we have the same sense of humor.

" My best friend and I are awesome together. We always seem to be on the same wavelength and have a ton of inside jokes with each other. We play the same games and have mostly the same interests.

",TRUE
" My best friend and I are always confiding in each other - not to the point where everything we think about is relayed, but the important stuff we know we want each other to know and not tell everyone else. We always drink together, travel together, and overall have a lot of fun together. We're almost never doing social things without each other. We get frustrated with each other a lot, but in the end it's never that big of a deal.
",TRUE
" The reason that I consider this individual my best friend is because of multiple reasons. First is trust, We have been friends for almost 20 years and not once have him or I gave a reason to not trust or not show loyalty.

I did not hesitate in loaning her cash to get her through the tough time.
",TRUE
" Felix is probably my best friend, now. We are good friends because we are interested in many of the same things: from anti-capitalism to music.

When my first child was born, and my wife was laboring in the hospital for 10 hours, he was there the whole time in the waiting room for support and to get us anything we needed.  My best friend is truly one of a kind!

We have the same interests, friends, jobs, and are able to tell each other what is really going on in our minds at all time.  I think of this person more as a brother than a friend.
",TRUE
" I'm friends with a girl I met in high school. We met because we sat in a group of five or six students at the back of the school bus for three years.

",TRUE
" We have been best friends our entire lives. We have different personalities that normally wouldn't mesh well but we both have loved each other to set aside these differences since we were children. Neither of us is more in charge or gets more out of the relationship, we each provide different but equal shares. Sometimes she gets on my nerves but I know that its ok and I get over it because our relationship is way more good than bad. She feels the same way about me, our differences can cause small arguments but they never last more than a day.

",TRUE
" We've been friends since we were babies. Cousins actually who call each other sister. We can tell each other anything and do so. As kids we had a lot more freedom than our own kids did.  Exploring the neighborhood, standing high on the bridge waving to the train drivers so they'd blow their whistle at us, hanging out at the beach, picking up boys, doing things we weren't supposed to do. Answering the phone at all hours, no matter what. Living thousands of miles from each other makes us no less close. I carried her through her recent chemo and she has done the same for me. Deep discussions about the death of my father and her mother recently and macabre jokes and funny stories that only we can share.
",TRUE
