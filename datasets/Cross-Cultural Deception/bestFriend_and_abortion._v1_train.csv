I know that I can call her in the middle of the night if I need help and without a doubt she will be there for me and she will help me out. For example, couple of weeks ago I was organizing a very important event for me and she was always happy to help me with organizing, cooking and photographing. We are like sisters and even when we are not able to see each other, we are always in touch via Facebook or phone.

" Me an my best friend have known each other for a while. We are on the same wavelength when it comes to comedy. We have had a relationship where we can give each other a hard time and not take it personal. Just the other day I was making fun of him for having too much grease on his forehead and he took it like a champ. That sounds like a pretty good relationship.

" I've known my best friend since kindegarden. WE've grown up in the same neighborhood and went to the same high school. We stayed in touch though college, though drifted a bit. Once I was back, we picked right up and we've been close ever since. I've known him for almost 30 years!

" My friendship with my best friend is quite good, I think.  Like most people who spend a lot of time together, we do have some occasional problems, but I think part of what makes our relationship great is that we're able to get over most sorts of issues and appreciate one another in the end.  We also have a lot of common interests and are happy to defer to the other person in order to make them happy, if necessary (though that's hardly necessary).  I think ultimately, we just get along really well and enjoy doing whatever together, even if it's not the most fun thing in the world.  For instance, I remember once it was late at night and we were both really tired and out of our minds, and we just had a really good conversation that lasted ages.  Neither of us had anything in particular to say or do, but we were able to just talk and enjoy the company of one another without any awkwardness or pretense.

We get frustrated with each other a lot, but in the end it's never that big of a deal.

First is trust, We have been friends for almost 20 years and not once have him or I gave a reason to not trust or not show loyalty.

When I was in college and having trouble with a class he was willing to come over and help despite just working back to back 12 hour shifts at work before my test.  When my first child was born, and my wife was laboring in the hospital for 10 hours, he was there the whole time in the waiting room for support and to get us anything we needed.

We have the same interests, friends, jobs, and are able to tell each other what is really going on in our minds at all time.  I think of this person more as a brother than a friend.

" We have been best friends our entire lives. We have different personalities that normally wouldn't mesh well but we both have loved each other to set aside these differences since we were children. Neither of us is more in charge or gets more out of the relationship, we each provide different but equal shares. Sometimes she gets on my nerves but I know that its ok and I get over it because our relationship is way more good than bad. She feels the same way about me, our differences can cause small arguments but they never last more than a day.

Answering the phone at all hours, no matter what. Living thousands of miles from each other makes us no less close. I carried her through her recent chemo and she has done the same for me.

" Legalized abortion is absolutely necessary.  Without it, women needing abortions would have to turn to seedy, back alley clinics to receive the treatment, which puts them at risk for uterine infection, medically necessary hysterectomies, and even death.  Women should also have the right to chose what happens to their own bodies.  Even if a woman consents to sex and decides that her body should not have to bear and birth this child, she then should able to make that decision on her own, without feeling like she has no choices.

" Abortion is murder and people who kill others should be put to death. It goes against the teachings of the Bible and is the worst kind of sin. We should do everything to stop it, no matter the cost. People should be ashamed for even thinking about having an abortion.
",FALSE
" Abortion is simply a mother's choice about when she would like to have a baby. The fetus is not a human being, and if carried to term, would represent a hardship to the mother in one way or another, so it's entirely a woman's right to terminate the pregnancy if she so chooses.

" Abortion kills babies! We all have a heartbeat at 18 days old, who can justify killing a baby with a heartbeat? Every baby has a right to live. No child is unwanted, there always will be a place for our precious little ones. Abortion is killing our babies and our futures with them.
",FALSE
" A baby should not be punished for a woman's mistakes. At the end of the day, abortion is the murder of an innocent baby. How can anybody allow that to take place? It's disgusting and nothing short of murder. If the woman doesn't want to raise her child, there's always the option of adoption.
",FALSE
" Abortion is morally and religiously wrong.  If a woman is pregnant, it is clearly God's choice that she carry the baby to term.  Also, life begins at conception so on a moral ground abortion is 100% wrong and should be illegal.  Not to mention that some abortion facilities have shoddy practices and could potentially endanger a woman's life if she were to get an abortion there.  Coat hanger abortions should very easily cause a woman to die, along with the child if it were able to be born at the time of the abortion.
",FALSE
" Abortion is not murder.  A baby is not considered a human being until it exits the womb and takes its first breath.  Up until that point it is just a mass of cells that does not have life, feel pain, or exist as a human.  Until the baby exits, it is simply a piece of a mother's body, such as an arm or leg.
",FALSE
" I believe a woman should not get an abortion for no good reason, she should be have the baby no matter what the concerquences. She should have the baby life is too important to discard like that. It's important to take care of the baby and not treat it like a problem by getting an abortion. Life is precious and should be pro choice.
",FALSE
" I believe that god thinks its wrong to have an abortion. The woman should not have the right to kill the child. I believe with fully certainty that the child is alive and a person and that killing it is murder. A woman shouldn't have the right to have an abortion in cases of rape or incest and the government should step in and banned women's rights to have abortions.

" I think abortion is an abomination! The people that are willing to kills their children, Gods creations! It is absolutely disgusting! We must not let these liberal dogs run rampant killing our innocent children. There is no question what a moral individual would vote for in this topic. Vote for the right choice. Life.
",FALSE
" I believe that a fetus is a ""baby"" at the point of conception. If a woman chooses to abort a pregnancy then she is committing murder. There are no circumstances in which I believe an abortion is safe and/or necessary. I also believe that a father has a say over the life he helped to create so a woman seeking an abortion should not be allowed to do so if the father does not consent. I feel like there are other viable alternatives, such as adoption, that a woman could turn to in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion should be illegal because the unborn child is a living person. The child does not have the right to make a decision if it wants to be here or not and what gives anyone else that right.I believe that a person should be held accountable for a child if they get pregnant becuase they made the choice to have sex.

" The child is the most important thing. Abortion is murder. If you have an abortion you will go to hell. Abortions takes children away from adoptive parents.
",FALSE
" Forcing women to have children they do not want places a burden both on the mother and on society.  There are far too many instances of children being born to 'parents' who consider them a 'mistake' after having unprotected sex.  Society cannot continue to provide unlimited care for these unwanted children.  It's like saying ""Just because I ate that cake, I don't want those extra pounds.""  It was your choice, sweetheart, live with it.
",FALSE
" Abortion gives women an easy way out of their accidental responsibilities so that they become unaccountable for their sexual escapades. Abortion means the killing of life after conception. Abortion affects women emotionally and can leave a lasting psychological affect. The taking of life is not of God's will as he created women to procreate.
",FALSE
" I think a woamn has the right to choose the fate of her unborn child because it is a private issue and it is her body. People make mistakes and if a woman makes the mistake of an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to end that pregnancy. Years ago, woman didn't have that right and abortions were a very risky thing to do by yourself. Many women died trying. Not only that but finding a Doctor to before an abortion was very hush, hush. They were hard to find. Now it can be done in medical clinics specializing in abortions and its done in a very dignified way. Women should be so lucky.
",FALSE
" I don't believe abortion is wrong. The fetus in the womb is not a human being. It is not really a baby or person after conception. It is similar to a fish living in water. It is only a mass of cells that could turn into a human being later on at birth. Since this mass of cells is not human and is not a person, there is no morality involved in the destruction of it. Therefore, a woman has the power to choose what her body does. If she doesn't want to be pregnant, she can abort the fetus. It is her decision to have an unwanted pregnancy terminated.
",FALSE
" Women should have the right to choose what happens with their own bodies and how they live their lives.  Pregnancy and childbirth are opportunities only provided to women and women should be able to control what happens to themselves.  Accidental pregnancies do happen.  As long as abortions are done in the early weeks of pregnancy, prior to full development, women should be able to choose whether or not they carry the baby to term.
",FALSE
" I believe it is ok to have an abortion. That you wouldn’t be judged by people who don’t believe this issue is right. I think that everyone should support a woman that wants an abortion regardless of their personal beliefs. I think Christians ran businesses should not complain about having to provide coverage for abortion in an insurance policy.
",FALSE
" Life begins at the moment of conception. If you choose to have sex, you choose to take on the responsibility of birth control. If you fail to take responsibility for your action and thus get pregnant you create a life that has a right to be given a chance, just like you once were. If you're not prepared to be a parent there's long waiting lists of deserving couples who can't conceive on their own who would make wonderful parents. Be responsible, give life to the life you created.
",FALSE
" I think that abortion is the mother's choice. She is in control of her own body. If she does not want a baby to grow inside of it, no one should be able to force her to do so. An embryo at a very early stage has not developed a personality. Hopefully, they have little or no awareness and will feel little or no pain. So, if the pregnancy is terminated it will be as if the embryo never existed. This is better than bringing a baby into the world that is abnormal, unwanted, or to a mother that is incapable of taking care of it.
",FALSE
" Fetuses have a right to live. If you can't accept the possibility of giving birth, you shouldn't have sex. Pregnancy is a gift, and you shouldn't be ungrateful and try to return it. Your body isn't -just- your own, it belongs to everyone, to god, to the human race. Think of how cute babies are, and everything else will fall into place.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is ok because it is simply a way of preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  A child is not viable outside the womb until the late stages of pregnancy and it can reasonably be argued that if life is not viable outside the womb, it is not a life with value and protection in and of itself.  It is not yet a separate and distinct entity. We have a clear standard in society for what does and does not constitute life.  As long as a woman carries a pregnancy and the fetus in the womb is not viable, it is still ultimately her decision as to whether she wants to carry this pregnancy in her body.  This is a decision that belongs only between a woman and her doctor.
",FALSE
" I beleive the system that supports abortions is necessary. If we don't possess anything else in society we own the right to make our own decisions and choices. A woman should be able to choose whether or not her body will be used to support life. If she chooses not too that is her right.  There are several woman that have been robbed of their choice to conceive in the first place and to not give them a means to decide whether or not they want to live with a constant reminder of how their rights and body were initially violated would be cruel and insensitive.  There are also other women that simply don't have the financial,emotional,or physical means to raise a child. I would rather them to make the choice early than to give birth to a child that does not have a fighting chance. At the end of the day it is the womans body and it should be her choice.
",FALSE
" A baby is a human at the moment of conception. There was a Pennsylvania abortionist who was charged with killing babies that were born alive, but he killed them by severing their spinal cords or slitting their necks. If abortion is legal then a lot of abortions are done as a matter of convenience. If women would take care of protecting themselves and we made that more of a priority unwanted pregnancies would significantly reduce.

",FALSE
" Even before it is born, a child is a separate person, entitled to all the rights of other living human beings. Its unique DNA and personhood make it separate from the mother, who has no right to judge whether the child lives or dies. Once a child is conceived, it is the duty of the mother and society to protect it. If the birth parents cannot take care of the child, adoption is the more preferable option.

" Abortion is a good thing. For one, the baby in my opinion is not a human being the first several months. The baby does not have a conscious at this point, therefore we can decide if we want to kill it or not. It is unborn and therefore not a human. It is okay.

" Abortion is perfectly fine in any and all situations. A woman has sole rights to do what she wants with her body. A fetus is just a fetus and not a human being.

" I am completely pro-life. To kill a baby in the womb is murder. Also it's against Gods will. whoever chooses to have an abortion will burn in hell.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be considered a complete disregard for life.  Life begins at conception and to take a life of a child is a unlawful and full of sin no matter what the age.  People don't know what is best for them in a stressful situation, and when a person is considering abortion, they are not able to think straight about what they are truly doing to an unborn living human being.  A child is a gift to the world and should be treated as such with all the same consideration ever other human being gets.
",FALSE
" Abortion is against God's will.  How will the world ever get better if we allow people to make choice that are against the will of the Creator?  Abortion can ruin a woman's chances to ever bear children again.  It should not be an option at all because there are services available to help women who wish to give up their children for adoption.

" Abortion is murder. A fertilized egg immediately becomes a person whose rights need to be protected. It is unconscionable to allow millions of babies to be murdered for the convenience of a woman who was not responsible enough to use birth control.

" I believe that abortion is moral in any situation. A mother has the right to decide what happens to her body and if she doesn't want a baby then she has the right no get rid of it. A fetus is not a living person yet so it has no rights. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and a person should not have their life ruined because of one mistake.
",FALSE
" I believe that under no circumstances, should an abortion be allowed, as life is a gift from God and we are given souls at conception. Regardless of circumstance a woman (including rape victims), should give birth to the child as it’s not that child’s fault.  They can always give the child to an adoption agency if they don’t want it. Anybody considering abortion should look at themselves in a mirror and ask what if my parents had done the same.

" I believe abortion is evil and murder.  It is clearly taking away a human life, and I imagine that anyone would want to live, if given a choice.  I believe that women are frivolous and cannot be trusted to make appropriate choices, therefore it is up to the lawmakers to ensure that these women make the correct choice.  Abortion should definitely be illegal, with stiff penalties for the woman who had the abortion, the doctor who performed it, and any other accomplices.  Penalties should be fines for the woman, and jail time or loss of license for the doctor.

" This law should be prohibited and all rights to such an action should be vanished. Life should not be something decided.

",FALSE
" Abortion is a women's right to be able to choose what to do with their body. It is not up to a man or government to tell a woman what they can do with their body. It is moral to have a abortion. A fetus is not living until later in the pregnancy.

" I believe in pro-life. Abortion is the act of killing a fetus. A baby human who is defenseless. If mothers don't want to raise their baby they can give it up for adoption. Abortions causes a lot of stress on a woman's reproductive system and may cause health complications for that woman in the future. Women need to control their bodies by being responsible and using contraception. in the case of rape, the rapist should be punished. Do not punish the defenseless unborn baby.
",FALSE
" I am not against abortion.  I am against the notion of killing human beings, and abortion falls under this spectrum.  If people don't want to have babies then they shouldn't be having sex.  Everyone knows how a baby is made and they should not be allowed to kill a living human being just because they screwed up.  Do we allow people to kill their accountant if he screws your taxes up?  A resounding no, and abortion is no different.
",FALSE
" I believe that all abortion is wrong.  It is murder.  The fetus is a human life and no one has the right to end that life.  Adoption could always be an option.  Abortions are too easily available and are misused as a form or birth control.  Careful sex or family planning is a more viable option.
",FALSE
" Abortion should absolutely not be an option for pregnant mothers.  If a mother is pregnant, she must go through the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption if she does not want to take care of it.

" I believe abortion should be legalized in every state across the world. It is a sin to believe that a person can just choose to let a pure innocent child die. God is watching always at the activities and decisions we humans make and God will surely see the horrible decisions those who choose to carry about abortion make. It is murder. Plain and simple. That child did nothing to deserve an untimely death before it has even had the chance to see the world.

" I am absolutely pro-life.  I think that all babies have the right to live, and it shouldn't matter what the mother's circumstances are.  It is legally and morally wrong to kill an innocent child.

On one hand, I am a feminist and I think that women should be able to do with their bodies what they feel is best, but on the other hand, what they are able to do with abortion affects not only their bodies but their unborn babies, as well as the father (sometimes).  It is hard to feel sorry for a woman that chooses abortion if she chose not to use birth control, more specifically condoms.  Any woman raped should be able to choose medical abortion, but I really strongly feel that abortion should not be a means of birth control.  It should always, always be a last resort, and women who get multiple abortions should be bitch-slapped.

" I believe that abortion is wrong because it takes away a human life. Abortion is not just about the mother's choice - it takes away any choice the baby had in it's life. To choose abortion is to choose your own happiness over the very life of another human being. It is selfish at its core, and it is sad that in our country, it is acceptable to be so selfish that you actually kill another person in order to preserve your own comfort and standard of living.

There are too many unwanted children in this world and many of them will grow up in foster homes and foster care, which is not an environment that any child should have to endure. In addition, some pregnancies are caused by incest and rape, and a woman should have the right to decide whether to continue on with that pregnancy or not.

I don't believe they should be required to view an ultrasound beforehand or any other such procedure. At the end of the day, pregnancy is a huge burden on the body, and a person should not be required to go through that if they choose not to. Furthermore, I don't consider a fetus to have the same status as a full person deserving of human rights. Within the first two trimesters, the fetus is part of the woman, completely dependent on feeding off her body for its life, and so I believe the woman has the right to choose to have it removed from her body. However, I am unsure of my position on later term abortions, because I believe that once the fetus has the potential to survive outside the womb, it may be deserving of human rights.

" I think abortion should be legal up to the third trimester.  It's a woman's right to choose whether or not she gives birth to the baby.  Also, Roe v.

Before that, all abortions are, in my opinion, okay.

" My reason for being against abortion is simply that it is cold blooded murder.  A baby can be aborted well after it has established a heart beat.  It is a living human being from the moment of conception.  Over 1,000,000 soldiers have died fighting in wars for the United States.  Since 1972, there have been over 50,000,000 abortions.  This is truly a form of genocide in today's world that is allowed without blinking an eye.

This is a very controversial topic around liberals and conservatives.

" Although abortion has been practiced throughout history, much of it was due to the low regard for women's health.  Permitting a pregnancy to run its course should be as acceptable as making a baby in the first place.  Yes, there will be women who look upon having a baby as a step back from the progress women have been making overall, but I believe that if two people decide to have sex, they should welcome the potential consequences, not suck it out with a vacuum.  Of course, rape and the health of the mother are the two reasons why abortions should be performed, but they should not be performed if the resulting child interferes with the lifestyle of the mother.  No one asked the child to be conceived; no one asks it if it wishes to be born.

" I believe abortion is killing a human being. The physical life of a distinct human individual begins at conception, and all through the pregnancy this human being is formed, growing, and changing in the womb. God is the creator of human life. No matter what the circumstances, at conception an actual living person is created. In God's eyes, the killing of this person in the womb is sin. It is murder. Most of the time a woman aborts a baby because she doesn't want to live with the consequences of her choice to have intercourse. Babies are a natural result of having intercourse.

" Once conceived, the baby inside your womb is no longer a part of just you, it is a creation of a new life.  The DNA is not an exact replication of you but is of that as an entirely unique individual from the moment of conception.  As you would not kill another member of society, you also do not have the right to estinquish this new life from entering the world.  There are so many choices that you should consider when you find out that you are carrying a new life.  So many couples want children and are not able to conceive one of their own.  If you are not ready to handle the responsibilities of parenthood consider giving the gift of life to another who so desperately wants to raise a child.

They should have a private insurance that covers abortions just like they have car insurance. Therefore, those who want to do these can be covered.

" A woman has the right to choose whether or not to have sex with a man, whether or not to marry, why would she not also have the right to choose whether or not to become a Mother? Recently a man in congress who was campaigning for anti-abortion was asked, ""Why do you think a woman would want to get an abortion?"" His response was, ""I've never really thought about it!"" Think about that. A man who will never get pregnant, never feel a life growing inside of him, never be exposed to the pain and risks of giving birth has never thought about why a woman would want to have an abortion and yet he is campaigning for the law that wouldn't allow a woman to have that option. I got pregnant at fifteen years old. I did not make the decision to have sex, I did not fail to use birth control during a voluntary act. I was walking home from gymnastics and I was raped. I was not prepared to be a Mother physically, I was not equipped to carry the child of a rapist emotionally. Had I not had that option available to me I don't know what would have happened. Before you take part in trying to make a decision for a woman, try walking a day in a woman's shoes.

" I believe that abortion is horrible. A mother's role is to take care of and protect a child. For the first nine months of a child's life, she does this inside of her own body. However, just because the baby is so helpless at this stage and no one has met it yet, a mother may feel that she is in control of its destiny. So, she thinks it is her choice whether the baby lives or dies. To make herself feel better, she calls the baby an embryo. Instead of murder, she calls it abortion or termination. People think that an unborn baby is not alive because it is small. But if something growing with a heartbeat is not alive, what is? There are people hooked up to machines to put air in their lungs and keep their heart beating. They have less life function than an embryo, and yet it would be illegal to disconnect them from their life source. Why? Because we can see their faces, that's why. Somebody had a chance to love them, that's why.

" I believe that people should be able to decide who is in their body when, at all times. There should be absolutely no restrictions on ending a pregnancy - noting that 'ending a pregnancy' does also include birthing a live child. You are never obligated to give up your body or your bodily products to anyone, including a fetus. You get to decide if that fetus can keep leeching your nutrients and blood and doing irreparable damage to your body, you get to decide whether or not to donate your blood, marrow, or kidney's to your dying relatives, you get to decide whether people get to have your organs when you are dead and not using them anymore or even aware of what is happening to them. Bodily autonomy is a cornerstone of freedom itself, and without it you lose the justification for criminalizing any and all interpersonal violence.

" I believe abortion is wrong because it is the taking of a human life.  We all started out the same way, a sperm joined to an egg, multiplication of cells, continued growth and development until we became who we are today.  A baby grows in it's mother's womb, but it is it's own being with it's own organs, nerves, and as science continues to develop, we know the baby even has its own thoughts and feelings. If we lower the standard for life to only include those who can survive independently of another, we are on a slippery slope to saying many already here are not entitled to life, including severely malformed and retarded, and chronically ill and elderly who may depend on machines for food and oxygen. I believe life starts at conception and we should respect life in all its forms.

" I beleive that abortion is a cruel and inhuman way that ultimately ends a childs life.  I feel the length of time given to a woman to terminate pregnancy is entirely too long and at that point it is what appears to me to be legal murder. I witnessed an abortion when I made a decision to support a family member who felt it was her only choice. I quickly found out that there has to be a better way. I don't know exactly what the answer is, but clearly abortion is not the correct one. If I understand correctly, a woman can be up to 24 or 25 weeks and still terminate. This is a person, although small, but one that has eyes, a nose, mouth, etc....Thats life. And the ability to give something that we don't have the ability to give legally that could have been avoided by other means just seems a bit wrong to me.

Many of these children will be in the lower social hierarchy for their entire lives. Legal abortion is a very safe procedure. There are also many religions that are actually pro choice.

" Abortion is not a positive experience and rarely one taken lightly. However, the ability for a person to control whether or not they have children is an important right. Until a child is born, the fetus is effectively part of the mother and therefore under her control as part of her body.

I strongly believe in free will and feel that the freedom of choice is lumped right in there with it.  Who has the right what I or any other person to do to their own body.  If that begins, where will it end. Abortion is a well thought out concept that allows one to consider the possibilities of what life they can life and provide for a child they might not want.  Is it fair to bring a child into a world were it could possibly be unloved and unwanted by its parents.  How is that any better of a life?

" Personally I’m somewhat against abortions beyond the third week of pregnancy, I believe that by this point the fetus is developed enough to be considered a human and have rights. If the fetus is a product of rape no restrictions to abortion should apply, as her pregnancy was not by choice.

Any other choice would constitute slavery, by forcing the woman to continue carrying the fetus, and would be a removal of her agency.  She should be able to have an abortion at any time, even if she's nine months along.  However, I do not think this is a wise choice, but it should be an option, nonetheless.   I believe that facilities should be readily available, with educated doctors and counselors to help the woman make the absolute best choice for her and her life.  These facilities, ideally, would be inexpensive, or have means of helping her pay for her abortion.

" Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. Mistakes do happen and people have sex. One of the unintended/unwanted outcomes of having sex is the possibility of becoming pregnant. There are a lot of situations where this is not ideal - single motherhood, poverty. Why would anyone want to raise a child in those conditions? It is a burden on the taxpayer as the individual who had the child when they weren't ready will have to depend on taxpayers for assistance. I don't think I should have to pay higher taxes so people can have children. This is why abortion should be legal. I think there should be restrictions, like a pregnancy can be terminated at most when the woman is three months in. The fetus is not viable/cannot live outside the mother at this point.
",TRUE
" All human life is precious.  No one should ever abort a fetus for any reason.  There are always people out there waiting to adopt a beautiful baby.  So no matter what the situation, abortion is always wrong.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is wrong when used inappropriate. Regardless of the situation, abortion is taking a human life. Life begins at conception and terminating that life after it is created is killing. In certain cases, it may be entirely appropriate for an abortion to be performed such as in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother's life is in jeopardy. It makes it more palatable when one can understand that up to a certain point, there is no consciousness.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is a choice that a woman must make for herself. No one should have control of a woman's body and what she should be allowed to do with it. If she can not afford to care for the child she is carrying then she should not have it and allow herself and the child to be a burden on an already weakened government system. Our government has control of many things, but what precedent will it set once the government is allowed to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her god given property. Will we then be faced with government sanctions on what we wear? Who we have sex with and how we are to have sex with them? There needs to be a limit to government control and it can start with allowing women to make choices for situations regarding abortion.
",TRUE
" I believe that it is not abortion that is the problem. The problem comes back to women's rights. A women should be able to make that decision for herself. It is not up to those outside of the situation to determine what she should do.
",TRUE
" Abortion should be allowed. It is the woman's choice.   There are always special cercumstances in which abortion should be expected, such as if the mother was raped, or if the child's birth will cause serious risk to the mother, or if the child is deemed to come out with severs birth defects. It most certainly should not be used as a form of birth control, and there should be a strict limit on how many one can ahve in her lifetime.
",TRUE
" No one should be able to tell someone what they can & cannot do with their own body.  If a woman wishes to have an abortion she should be allowed to make this decision of her own free will without persecution.  It is not a black and white issue.  Abortion is not murder.
",TRUE
" I believe that woman should be able to get abortions for almost any reason. It is their body and their own choice. They should not be forced to support another living being if they don't want to do so. A fetus is not a person until after birth. Therefore, the mother supporting the fetus should not have to keep the baby.
",TRUE
" I feel that all life is sacred, and I feel even more strongly that conscious life should be allowed to control its own destiny.  I don't view unborn fetuses before a certain point as conscious life; really, it's more of a parasite than anything else.  I know this is a cold view to take but that's how I think.  My stepdad molested me and had sex with me when I was a teenager.  If I had gotten pregnant, and had been forced to endure bearing the child to term, my life would have been drastically different.  It would have negatively affected my physical health and development as well as my progress in my education, not to mention it would be a constant reminder of what I had gone through.  In cases of incest, abuse, rape, fatal fetal malformations, danger to the mother, or unplanned pregnancy, abortion should always be available as an option.  No child should come into the world unwanted.

" Firstly, the real issues here is life . Which to my best of knowledge that's been taught to me by my schooling is to respect the value of living . The art of living is just sensible enough to comprehend the meaning of life. By and large, with the teaching of the church of Christianiy no doubt that life is a must to uphold and behold. The Abortion issues is truly a disgusting concept to my best of understanding for it goes against the grain of all the doctrines of wisdom of man since the memorial times of existence.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is an acceptable practice. There have been instances of rape that caused impregnation, and these instances left the victim in the dilemma of carrying a child that is the result of a horrible crime. Since I believe that there is sound reasoning in accepting abortion at this juncture, this decision ought to be left to the discretion of the woman carrying the child. Whenever a woman becomes pregnant, she ought to have control over the destiny of her child.
",TRUE
" I do not believe in abortion.I had an abortion when i was 16 and it was a very emotional experience for me. I believe abortion to be murder because the fetus has a heart that beats,while inside the womb.After the fourth month,a mother can feel it moving inside her,some have been seen in ultrasound sucking their thumbs. I believe life begins at conception because if the fetus doesn't get the nutrients from the mother while in the womb,it will die.
",TRUE
" I am completely for abortion. I can understand those that oppose abortion as long as it is not for religious reasons, but I am for women's rights before an unborn fetuses rights. I know that it should be rights for both, but there is no way to have rights for both when the baby is a part of the mother. The mother gets priority, simple as that.
",TRUE
" I believe that a women has the right to do whatever she wants with her body.  Going through with an abortion is not a matter of which men can make a decision on, nor anyone else except that woman.  There are many instances when an abortion is appropriate, such as in cases of rape, or when a contraceptive fails.  I believe it always better to abort a fetus then to have a child you are not ready for or cannot care for.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion should be legal. Women deserve a right to their own body. Men should not be the ones who decide wether or not a woman has the right to abort her child. Abortion is the best option for some women whether it's because of rape or she got pregnant at a young age.  Sometimes it is better to abort a baby than have it be born into a terrible life.  Furthermore, if abortion is illegal then people will find other ways to abort their child. Also, if a women is forced to have her own child then men should be forced to stick around as well.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is wrong, unless the mother's life is in danger or she was the victim of sexual assault.  I know several female friends that have had babies.  Many of these ladies post pics from their ultrasounds on facebook as well as share them by other means.  They refer to the pics as 'their baby'; give it a name; they even have listened to their unborn baby's heartbeat.  If something has a heartbeat then it must be living.  In short, I think ending a pregnancy (unless to save the mother's life) is wrong.
",TRUE
" I think that while abortion is a horrible thing to do, it should be legal for anyone to get if they so choose. If people take precautions to avoid pregnancy and still get pregnant, abortion is a viable option. If someone uses abortion as their only form of birth control, they should be punished. A man and woman should decide together about weather abortion takes place. Men should also have the right, if they so choose, to legal decline responsibility for the child if they took precautions against pregnancy and the conception still takes place, and the mother decides against an abortion.
",TRUE
" I think that an individual's opinion on abortion should not dictate societal and legal stances on abortion.  Every situation is different, and while many other options are preferable, there are some cases where abortion is acceptable, recommended, or even the best option available.  I think it is up to the mother with child to determine the best course of events for her situation.  The act of shaming this choice leads to more harm than good.
",TRUE
" I believe that life begin at conception and that human life is sacred.  My views are based on my study of the Bible,which I believe is inspired of God.  God's word teaches that an unborn child, regardless of its age, is a human being. I strongly believe that abortion is murder and that an unborn child has every right to live, regardless of the circumstances under which it was conceived. Saying that a woman has the right to abort her child is like saying that we all have the right to kill our neighbor.
",TRUE
" I am a true believer in what this country ws founded on and that is freedom and democracy and in order to maintain the integrity in those principles we must practice them daily.I personally prescribe to the pro choice mentality for that  exact reason.It is not my right to choose for others but to accept those choices weather i agree with them or not.T here many circumstances that individuals may choose to have an abortion and unless we accept that as their choice we will be set back into the dark ages socially where abortions are performed in back alleys without proper medical equipment and care.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is an easy escape to being irresponsible. If you think your responsible enough to have unprotected sex, then shouldn't you be responsible enough to take care of a baby? The only way I think abortions should be allowed is in cases of rape, or life threatening pregnancies. Plus, there's thousands of families who wish to have kids and can't. If you become pregnant, and don't want the baby, just allow the baby a good like with someone that would want it.
",TRUE
" I support the right to access abortion services. Women, and their partners if applicable, need to have complete control over their reproductive faculties. Abortion is a safe means of preventing unwanted children. Terminating a pregnancy is no different than using birth control or other methods of contraception. Some would claim that abortion requires taking a life, but I believe that abortion is not much different that engaging in sexual activities for reasons other than procreation, since these often involve living cells being expended. Additionally, unwanted children can cause financial burdens to families which results in poor quality of life for the children.
",TRUE
" I am pro choice. I believe a woman has the right to make choices regarding her own body. I am an agnostic so my stance on abortion is not determined for me by the Catholic church or whatever religion I might belong to. As with most social issues abortion is very complex. However I believe that the only way to assess each abortion case is rationally and without religious bias.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is okay and is a valid option for some people.  That being said I believe it should be limited by how far along the pregnancy is, late stage abortions in my opinion are wrong.  Also abortion is an important option for those who have been raped.  I believe pregnancy should be prevented and can be easily prevented for those who wish to do so, that being said accidents do happen and an early abortion can be an option.
",TRUE
" Abortion is wrong. The minute a pregnancy is achieved, there is a life. If a woman makes the decision to have sex she should be prepared to deal with the consequences. Even if, the woman does not want a child there are many options such as adoption available. It is not right that a child be killed because a pregnancy is not convenient for the mother.
",TRUE
" I am pro choice.  I believe that a woman should always have the choice to what happens to her own body, therefore she should be the only person to decide weather to carry a baby to term. I don't think the unborn have a right to decide after all they have not been born yet.  The most important to consider is the woman and if she WANTS a child.
