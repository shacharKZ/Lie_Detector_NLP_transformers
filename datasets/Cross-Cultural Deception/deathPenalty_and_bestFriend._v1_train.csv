" The death penalty is a cruelty that needs to be abolished. Supposedly lethal injection is painless, but often the victims of this horrendous practice convulse in pain before their demise. Sometimes even a second injection must be made to actually achieve the desired result. This is a remnant of medieval torture that is somehow allowed to remain in the civilized world despite it's awful cruelty and needs to end.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is the ultimate eye-for-an-eye punishment and should be used more often. The death penalty sentence is not used unless criminals are guilty of heinous crimes, often involving multiple murders. Eliminating one person that killed multiple victims is the only justifiable punishment. These people are criminals and they do not deserve to continue to live in our prisons, costing tax payers money. Providing these criminals with a dignified, humane, and pain free death is more than they ever showed to their victims.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is definitely one punishment that should be carried out in several situations.  First of all, you get rid of a dangerous criminal without needing to spend the money to educate him/her.  It also sets an example which can help control the lower class people.  It shows that if you commit a terrible crime, you will die for it.  As a deterrent AND a punishment, the death penalty is, by far, an all-in-one type deal.
",FALSE
" Any chance the accused, no matter how small, is innocent means they should not be executed. Juries can be wrong. Life imprisonment is no picnic either, and that would be plenty of punishment, IMO. Maybe doing the execution promotes violence, saying the state can kill, and in some cases killing is OK. Is the reason to execute just vengeance? May not be enough, if you think about it.  Actually cheaper to do life imprisonment, instead of the never ending appeals. And the studies show the DP does not deter others from crimes.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is taking punishment far to extreme. Just because someone makes a mistake doesn't mean they should be killed for that fact. You are not there when the incident happened so you should not be able to decide the fate of another man. The death penalty is painful and taking it to the furthest point just so the government and prove a point.
",FALSE
" Taking a life is never the answer to any problem. Life without the possibility of getting out is deterrent enough. We as a society do not have to sink to the same level as the very criminals that we are sentencing. The fact that they are behind bars is more then enough to give us the peace that we need to sleep at night.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a severe but necessary punishment for the worst criminals in our society. It is the ultimate price, and those who would transgress against our laws must know that justice and retribution will come for the crimes they have committed. It is far cheaper to the taxpayer, and safer for society at large, to kill people that are that evil and dangerous. Imposing a death sentence also serves to give a measure of peace to the families of victims. Some people are monsters and just should not be on this earth.
",FALSE
" I oppose the death penalty because I feel that we as a society must rise above our animalistic tendencies for revenge.  We must show that we are better than those who we hold in judgment for their crimes.  The death penalty is an extreme act with no real value to society.  Many criminals who have perpetrated crimes upon society have been shown to be from very unfortunate circumstances.  These people were often abused as children, frequently have a below average IQ, and studies have shown that brain chemistry can be a factor in criminal behavior which may render the criminal with a very limited capacity to make choices other than the ones they have made in life.  It can also be argued that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment because we do not have thorough enough research to understand all the physiological aspects of the suffering a person undergoes through the various means by which the death penalty is carried out.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be used as the court sees fit. I believe if a person does something that should get the death penalty then so be it. I feel killing someone, child rape, kidnapping, and any other horrid thing, then you should face the death penalty.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is not a good thing to have in any state, people can be falsely accused on a crime that they didn't do. It wouldn't solve any problems with crimes in their states having the death penalty and they will still continue to commit the crimes and it wouldn't even bother them. It's not a good option to have and it should be stopped.
",FALSE
" Life is sacred. Who are we to end a life? People, even criminals, deserve to live. They deserve a second chance. When we end their lives, we end the possibility of them turning their lives around--even if that is within a prison setting.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is wrong every way you look at it. Who is to say that a person deserves to die based on a crime they commited. Do people think they are God now? Do they think the fate of someone''s life and death is in their hands?
",FALSE
" I think we should get rid of the death penalty. It is expensive and life in prison without the chance for parole is a lot better punishment than executing what may be an innocent man or woman. The death penalty is archaic and out dated. Plus most judges have struck it down as cruel and unusual punishment. Death Row should be a thing of the past.
",FALSE
" I love penalty death. The people who make severe mistake should be treated in the proper way. Death is a final procedure. It worth to do so.
",FALSE
" Anyone who commits murder deserves no less for themselves.  They need to know that they cannot get away with taking another’s life.  What better way than to know that what awaits you if you commit murder is that you will have your own life taken from you?  Some may argue that the in today’s system, rarely does anyone on death row actually ever be put to death.  True.  So get rid of all of the bureaucracy!  If a jury finds someone guilty, put them to death without delay.  I’m not arguing that there shouldn’t be mandatory appeals, but fast-track them.  There are those that argue that some innocent people have been put on death row, but evidence and witness memories don’t get better with age.  There is no reason a victim’s family should have to suffer more than the person who committed the crime.
",FALSE
" The Death Penalty is just another form of murder. People who support the death sentence are just as bad as the guilty who are sentenced to die. The bible says to forgive and people need to practice what they preach. It is not for us to decide who dies or lives no matter what they do to others.
",FALSE
" The value of human life is too precious to throw away so callously.  There is no difference between the crime committed by the accused and the government system that carries out the death penalty.  Murder is still murder even if it is in the name of justice. Prison does enough to isolate the criminals from society, and allows the everyday citizen to feel safe without resorting to governmental and systematic slaughter.
",FALSE
" I believe that the death penalty is a horrid thing! Killing people is never right no matter what they did! Honestly would you want someone to kill you because you made a mistake? What about your family?
",FALSE
" I believe that everyone should receive mercy and that should be released from the death penalty. That killing the murders is wrong and killing them is the easy way out for them. We should let them all live out their days in prison. We as a human race are better than to kill people.
",FALSE
" It is not right to kill. The death penalty cost the states a great deal of money more than life. A person should have to live with their past. Death is to easy. It would be better if the person payed back their debt to society.
",FALSE
" There are some people in our society who do not belong in it.  They made that choice, but they don't think they should have to live with it...or die by it.  Wrong, my friend: You decided to unleash your hatred of the good people of our society by doing your heinous crime and now you must pay the price by giving up your right to live.  I'm not saying we have to dance in the streets when a criminal is executed, but we have to be loud and clear that they are responsible for their actions and must accept the consequences.  Without just rules governing societal behavior, we will descend into anarchy, chaos, and the collapse of civilization.  I didn't yip and yap with pleasure when Bin Laden was killed, but I certainly did not mourn his passing.  I feel the same about murderers and rapists..there is no room in society for these foul criminals.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is painless all the time. The death penalty does no harm and is quick. The death penalty does not cost much to administer. The death penalty is always a 50/50 chance at life.
",FALSE
" All life is sacred.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Even if someone did something horrible, they shouldn't have to die.  They're still a human being and deserve to be treated like one.
",FALSE
" I believe that taking a life, no matter how awful the crimes are is wrong. Each person is placed on this planted for a reason and to take that person off the planet is wrong. No matter what, a person deserves to live a life even if it is behind bars. Sometimes people are accused of crimes that they did not commit and if they are put to death then that would be considered murder.
",FALSE
" Society needs the death penalty. It deters future criminals and is the only way for families to obtain retribution and move on. There is no disproportionate discrimination in society; the people who get the most death sentences just happen to be minorities. We cannot do without the death penalty because it teaches people that they cannot just get away with capital crimes.
",FALSE
" The death penalty doesn't teach a criminal a lesson, because if they are killed they are no longer alive to learn from it. It also does not seem to be very convincing to other criminals, our murder rates are at a high even with the death penalty in place. If thou shall not kill, we are being hypocritical by telling the murderer he is wrong but we are also going to murder him or her. If it does not dissuade, then it serves no purpose. Being sentenced to prison for life is actually worse punishment, as that person will have to live with what they have done every day, and also suffer attacks from other prisoners, especially child molesters and killers.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a travesty and affront to the civilized world. Almost every other developed country has banned this despicable practice. Murder sanctioned by the state is never right and that is what the death penalty is. Not only does it sometimes result in the killing of an innocent man it wastes tax payer dollars in endless appeals.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is important because it acts as a deterrent. Criminals need to know that if the commit a severe enough crime, there's a chance the state will have them killed. The states that don't allow the death penalty are all bleeding-heart liberal states. Texas has the right idea.
",FALSE
" It is morally wrong to kill. We are putting people in jail for crimes like murder and then using the legal system to turn around and murder them as well. We cannot impress upon people that a certain crime is wrong if we then use that same crime to punish them for - the same crime. It does not teach people a lesson.
",FALSE
" I am totally for the death penalty ! If you kill someone or brutally rape someone, you should fry for it ! ""An eye for an eye"" should be our motto in capital cases. Maybe then, people will think twice before they kill somebody.
",FALSE
" The death penalty saves tax payers money.  Why should I pay for criminal's expenses instead of letting them die.  After all, most murders deserve death since they kill others.  We should execute more prisoners.
",FALSE
" Our families are not safe.  People are murdered on the streets; Homes are being invaded; Gangs are controlling entire neighbourhoods.  Our judicial system needs the death penalty as a strong deterrent to this out of control violence.  The death penalty has been used in every part of the world for thousands of years and has not been found to be immoral or unjust.  We need to keep the death penalty and use it more often to protect our families and our country.
",FALSE
" How would you feel if your loved one was brutally murdered? Most people would want to get closure, and the only way to do that would be to take ""an eye for an eye"". The man or woman who kills must realize the consequences of such a heinous action. If people truly know that they will get the death penalty, they will be deterred from killing in the first place and crime will decrease.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is not a deterrent at all.  What it really is is a burden on taxpayers who pay for death row convicts to live out their lives in prison.  In addition, there have been so many convicts later proven innocent with updated technology such as DNA.  Man is not God; man makes mistakes, and having just one person wrongly killed under the death penalty is one too many.
",FALSE
" What if the alleged offender seeked justice on a wrong doer, avenging. There have been self defense cases where one defended himself and received this harsh penalty. Why are those who judge the offenders get a watch someone die slow that never harmed them? Sometimes, this penalty is praised.
",FALSE
" The death penalty prevents death. It discourages criminals from committing the ultimate crime, because that they too might die because of their deed. Having a death penalty marks off this one crime as the one that cannot be made up for, and cannot (in theory) end in a short sentence and a slack probation. Where a death penalty is in force, killers know they will not be freed to kill again.
",FALSE
" We are a country of laws and regulations that are for the saftey of the majority. Some crimes are so bad that we must remove those offenders from our society completely because it is not worth the risk of keeping them. Some people there is no hope of rehabilitating and it is unfair to ask us to continue to pay to keep them in the system when there is no hope of them turning there life around. The death penalty is about keeping our children and society safe and not burdening the tax payer, it is also setting an example to discourage criminals from committing those crimes.
",FALSE
" Every action has consequences. Sometimes these consequences are good, and sometimes they are bad. These consequences are distributed in proportion to the action. Capital punishment is one of these consequences. It is reserved for the most heinous of crimes, always involving murder. By being a citizens of this country, you agree to follow the law. Everyone knows that when breaking the law, you will get punished. In this sense, capital punishment is not immoral; it is the pre-determined punishment for especially egregious crimes. If a murderer wants to keep his life, he should have considered this basic principle before committing the crime. There is no reason the worst criminals in this country should be exempt from the appropriate punishment.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is an inhumane way to deal with prisoners.  Although the crimes committed by these individuals range in severity such as serial raping, murder, and other atrocious crimes, the people who committed these are crimes are human.  These people should be given a life in prison, where they can be controlled and separated from society so they no longer are a threat, while we do not stoop to their level and take their lives from them.  By killing them, we are becoming what they are.  The death penalty has been used in the past, and innocent men have lost their lives due to this.
",FALSE
" Sometimes a crime is committed that is so odious to the moral sense that only supreme justice is called for. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter capital crimes. It can purge society's lingering guilt in the fact that justice is complete and final. Victims' families can get some well-deserved closure and society can move on from the crime without having to wait for a life sentence to be served.
",FALSE
" The notion that innocent people are wrongfully killed because of the death penalty is vastly overblown. Criminal trials take too much time, money, and effort for a completely innocent person to be convicted time and time again. Just because someone says that they are innocent, doesn't make it so. A jury found them guilty for good cause, and people are often hesitant to hand out the death penalty. It's clear that there are times when a crime deserves a punishment like death, and any other punishment would be too easy. Having them rot in prison is just a drain of tax money. The death penalty deserves to stay.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is necessary because it deters some of the most serious crimes. If people fear the death penalty, they will be less likely to commit terrible crimes.  If our only punishment is to lock them away in a jail, it is not enough of a deterrent.  If someone takes the life of someone else, their life should be taken from them.
",FALSE
" I don't think the death penalty should be allowed.  The death penalty is inhumane and no one has the right to take someones life.  Not even the government.  If someone murders a person then that person should go to jail for a really long time or even for the rest of their lives.  As long as they are kept outside of society we can be safe.  There is no need to kill them in order to protect society.
",FALSE
" If a person killed another person they should always receive the death penalty.  An eye for an eye seems to fit in this case.  The death penalty may deter some people from killing another person.  However, a truly evil person probably wouldn't pay attention to that.
",FALSE
" The absence of a death penalty would encourage potential pursuers of capital crimes to go forwards with their intentions. Even if they're caught, the law won't permit them to be physically harmed. In fact, there is even a chance they could settle down with a nice life in prison with friends, spouse, etc. Only the threat of death will be enough to dissuade sane but evil criminals from enacting their murderous plans.
",FALSE
" I think that it is inhumane to kill anyone - even people who have tortured and murdered others.  They have souls and it is possible for them to change their hearts.  They should be allowed to live comfortably in prison for the rest of their lives to think about what they have done.
",FALSE
" I feel like the death penalty is absolutist 100% needed. I feel like there is no hope for anyone. If they are bad they will always be bad and the death penalty is for them. I feel like we should be using it more often because it will rid the world of those who cannot be saved!
",FALSE
" the death penalty should be abolished. killing someone non matter who they are is inhumane. there is no reason for someone to die no matter what kind of crime they committed. the drugs for the death penalty are expensive and in humane. killing someone in response to what they did is not equal. two wrongs do not make a right. the taxes paid for people on death row would be used for something else just as bad like bailing out companies that can't keep the finances together
",FALSE
" I believe the death penalty should never be an option for criminal punishment. It goes against my religious beliefs to condemn anyone to death, and I think supporting the death penalty is making oneself accessory to murder. The proper punishment for violent criminals should be rehabilitation, and if this fails imprisonment should be the last option to maintain public safety. The death penalty is never appropriate. The death penalty serves no purpose and destroys human compassion.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a great idea. If a person has committed such a hateful crime to another individual then they should pay the ultimate sacrifice by giving up there own life in return. Anyone who has a loved one that as life has been wiped out by another person deserves justice. This justice should be by removing the life from the person that caused such pain and suffering. It is my belief that a person who has received the death penalty has done something so immoral that the possibilities of that person ever being productive in society is very low. They would be of no use to society and the chances are they have to values or morals and any thing short of the death penalty would make them a danger to society.
",FALSE
" I never have believed in this part of the system. Why should someone that has it in their blood to kill someone else, have to face the death penalty. I wouldn't care of about that person, never liked them. They thought they were too good, so I'm going after them, where they will not see daylight again. They won't act like they are too good for me. I say, set them free, and continue with the next.
",FALSE
" To believe that repaying a murder with a murder is archaic. The death penalty in it's most simple nature is murder. The death penalty creates an environment where people can believe that in certain cases it is right to take a life and that you can make that decision. A better approach would be to rehabilitate a murder and return them as a productive member to society. This would teach that we all have a redeeming quality and would develop an environment that encourages people to find the good in one another and work through issues that they may have.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be left intact.  Why should the citizens pay their hard earn taxes for criminals to live? That money could be better spent elsewhere such as schools or hospitals. The money could be better spent on bettering the community instead of housing more criminals that contribute nothing to society.
",FALSE
" The death penalty can be categorized as cruel and unusual punishment, banned by laws in modern society. So why should the option even exist. There are too many innocent men and women convicted of crimes in our broken justice system that may even be facing the death penalty themselves. How is that fair? I do not think we are at the necessary level we need to be as a society to be accepting of the death penalty. It has been around since man invented the justice system. Dont you think we would have evolved since the middle ages?
",FALSE
" death penalty is right. an eye for an eye. if someone killed then why do you want to keep that person alive, i believe thats its right that the person be killed too so he suffers the same fate. if you decide to keep the person alive or in jail for a little period of time for her wrong doing then its tax payers people's money that shall be used to maintain him, i dont think thats right. kill him and be done with that chapter, also let the familyy of the offender know what it is to loose someone.
",FALSE
" A life given for one taken.  A sentence of death should make someone stop and think before killing another person.  Criminals convicted of the death penalty should be executed within a short period of time.  Death sentences instead of life in prison would save the penal system money.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a necessary practice. It provides justice and a sense of closure for grieving families of victims. It is only reserved for the vilest criminals. There is no purpose in keeping such evil people alive- it is simply a drain on taxpayer dollars to continually feed someone that has demonstrated any lack of morality or self-control. There is a growing problem with prison overcrowding as it is. There is simply no reason to keep certain criminals alive.
",FALSE
" I believe that regardless of what horrendous acts an individual performs, he or she is deserving of life. I don't think that the death penalty is justified because lots of prosecutional techniques aren't 100% accurate. Lots of innocent people have been put to their deaths, only to have the evidence be reexamined and the verdict overturned. If a system can't accurately and undisputably implicate an individual then capital punishment should not be enforced.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a cruel act. You're either electrocuted so that your insides are cooked. Or given a series of injections that paralyze you while you drown in your own bodily fluids. Or you're placed against a wall facing a gunman aiming a rifle at you, ready to give said wall a fresh coat of paint.

" The Death Penalty is immoral. It doesn't belong in our society. How can you justify one death for another? We aren't God therefore we shouldn't play him.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be allowed in instances that involve a horrendous crime particularly  those that destroy the lives of the people associated with the crime. There comes a point where a criminals action can be so grave that the court has the right to seek redemption by terminated that persons existence. It needs to be done ever so cautiously and as a last resort, but the criminal forfeited his/her rights when they  committed the atrocities.
",FALSE
" I don't believe the death penalty is necessary. People would be better to face humiliation and die in jail, living out a long life of solitude. They aren't hurting anyone or causing another person trouble if they're in jail being watched over. Killing people just shows how cruel a human being can be, why should we do the same?
",FALSE
" I feel the death penalty should be used more often.  When someone kills another human being, they should be punished just as they punished the deceased.  If we do not take their lives, they have not learned a lesson.  They could also go out and kill someone else, and we must stop that at any cost.
",FALSE
" Choosing to take the life of any being is wrong. We have no right to decide the value of life nor to take away the possibility of redemption in any form. There is always the possibility that the person could be wrongly convicted of a crime, and if their life was taken that would constitute a grievous murderous act.  Facilities are adequate to safe guard the person from ever returning to do harm thus negating the need to take a life. If the person is correctly convicted he is not adequately punished by offering death as a way out either. The crime ends with the incarceration and then the punishment of time living with the loss of freedom and the knowledge of what that person has done should be the way that we deal humanely with our criminal population.  The death penalty only brings more death.
",FALSE
" While the death penalty is often protested against for various reasons, these reasons amount to little more than emotional or idealistic pleas. The death penalty is important for our society to retain in an effort to preserve a sense of authority. A government exists because it has a monopoly on violence, and it's authority exists on its right to exercise that right. Give that we have a fair and just court system, we are in a unique position amongst the world's nations to flex that right to power in extreme circumstances. Though using this punishment doesn't lower all types of crimes, it is the case that it mitigates the level and types of crime people are willing to commit, while giving our laws themselves the safe-backing that they need to be legitimate in the eyes of the populace.
",FALSE
" Without the death penalty either or right or wrong you would have even more crime. Without a effective deterrent that even frightens people then you will ultimately just have a society that is about chaos instead of law and order. To keep other people from killing each other sometimes you have to have very severe consequences. You have to make people pause before they ever even dare think about taking another human beings life. Fear is sometimes unfortunately necessary to teach people right or wrong. You take a life you lose your life is the saying that is used and in some cases it is necessary.
",FALSE
" My view on the death penalty is that it is a good thing. The death penalty punishes those that commit severe crimes, by death. The death penalty also gives the victims families the much needed closure that they deserve. The penalty shows other would be criminals the severe consequences of bad actions.
",FALSE
" The people that oppose the death penalty have clearly never looked into the eyes of the victims of these criminals. Without the death penalty how can we tell them that justice has truly been carried out? In our state we should make it absolutely clear that we abhor these crimes. What better way to deter the criminal element than death? They may be able to make friends in prison, even thrive depending on their connections, but you cannot bargain or adjust to death.

" I believe death penalty is necessary to prevent further crimes in the future and punish the killers.

" I do not believe in the death penalty because it is not for us to decide when someone should die. These are human beings and everyone deserves the chance to change.

" The death penalty in America is a more efficient method of dealing with unreformable violent offenders. Prisons cost taxpayers $32 billion dollars every year and it is estimated that it costs $1.5 million dollars per inmate to keep them alive in prison for life. This price will rise and only to keep violent and dangerous people in the world. And this only serves to tell offenders they will be cared for in a safe environment for the rest of their lives.
",TRUE
" The death penalty, or capital punishment, is a barbaric and uncertain method to deal with criminals. There are too many cases that have been reopened and reexamined where new evidence exonerated people that have been on death row for years or decades. Because forensics and other investigation methods cannot be 100 percent sure of a result, there is no way to determine 100 percent that a person is guilty so applying a 100 percent punishment is overboard. We also cannot guarantee that the methods used for capital punishment are humane and pain free. There are many reports of death penalty sentences being carried out where the subject is suffering for long periods of time before expiring. The death penalty also violates the basic right that nobody should be subject to cruel and unusual punishment.
",TRUE
" I disagree with the death penalty because of its cost on taxpayers and the fact that there is no way to undo a wrongful death.  The appeal processes for people on death row is incredibly expensive, more expensive than that of a life sentence, and since there are so many prisoners right now, we end up paying a ton more for death row appeals.  Also, once an inmate is killed, there is absolutely no way that that act can ever be reversed.  Once the (wo)man's dead, there's no return.  I find it disgusting that we still kill inmates in our supposed ""land of the free"" country.
",TRUE
" Death penalty is the ultimate punishment. In my opinion, it should only be used for very serious crimes, and where the evidence is absolutely beyond a doubt. Eyewitness evidence, if only one person might not be enough. I am not completely against the death penalty, for those that do terrible crimes over and over again, show no remorse, etc., I think the death penalty is appropriate. It provides some small closure for family members of the victim.  One thing I come back to is the number of prisoners exonerated from DNA evidence. If they were executed, obviously no way back. Another thing against the DP is the cost, surprisingly more expensive to execute someone.
",TRUE
" The death penalty can do a few things. First and foremost it is used as an example. It shows that you cannot just live behind bars with your food paid for, there is something worse that can happen. In the Philippines i believe you are not allowed to even spit on the street. Thus they don't have to worry about crime because they see what happens when you make a mistake. Inmates cost the state and country an incredible amount of money. If you are someone that takes the lives of numerous people, then it would not be unreasonable for that favor to be returned.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a just deterrent for some of the worst crimes. There is not rehabilitating some criminals and for those the only answer is to put them out of their misery. There is no excuse to continue filling up prisons we can't afford to pay for. It is only fair to many of the families of the victims. It is time we clear out some of the burdens put on the states by allowing those that need it to be put to death.

" I am opposed to the use of capital punishment for several reasons. The first is that it is applied unequally. In cases where the death penalty could be sought, prosecutors sought that penalty only a very small percentage of the time. When it was sought, statistics show the African American men made up more than half of those cases, while they represent far less than half of eligible cases. That is discriminatory usage, and therefore wrong. The second reason I am against it is because sometimes mistakes will be made and it will be used on an innocent person.  Finally, I do not believe it serves as a deterrent to murderers. Lifetime incarceration is the appropriate punishment for severe crimes.

" I believe the death penalty is an appropriate punishment in our society.  It serves as both a punitive measure against the criminal and as a deterrent for others who may consider the same actions.  As a society that values life, we must have something in place that helps to keep order in society and serves as a measure to reduce the potential for capital crimes; capital murder, other felonies with extenuating circumstances, etc.  When someone has committed a heinous crime that takes away the sense of security in society and does grievous harm to a community and family, there is an innate need for justice.  We are a Christian nation and a nation that largely upholds certain biblical tenents, such as an eye for an eye.  While this may seem harsh to some, time and time again the death penalty has been shown to give a measure of comfort to families of victims.
",TRUE
" I do not believe in the death penalty at all for any reason. I was raised in a christian home with a father who a pastor. We are to forgive a person for what they have done and let God be the judge of the person who did the crime. As of now I still do not believe in the death penalty.

" I believe that the death penalty is a good way to get people to stop doing the awful crimes that has been going on for decades.

I believe that it should be apart of our judicial system.

" I am for the death penalty for the simple reason I believe it is the ultimate penalty for taking someone's life. Cruel and unusual punishment you say? Well think about the cruel and unusual murder that the murderer had on his victim. As speak about victim, I love how the state of California has a death penalty where the murderers on Death Row on average are there for 30 years. The idea is that these condemned men may not have done it and they should have the right to appeal, appeal and when in doubt appeal. Through political activism and with the help of liberal judges the death penalty in California is a sham. The people have spoken years ago and the Death Penalty should be the ""Law of the Land."" I think we should do what the people want.

" The death penalty is and always has been meant to be a deterrent to crime.  If you kill someone, you are meant to think that if you’re caught, you will die.  That is not the case.   I’m not sure it ever has been.  For whatever reason, people who commit murder are either very calculating and know they will get away with it, or they do it in the heat of whatever anger or drug rage brought it about.  In neither case would someone stop to think rationally, if I do this, I might die.  Even if they did, by the time they’ve lived through all of the mandatory appeals, it is hardly worth anyone’s money time, or effort.  The victim’s family might disagree, but if the death penalty weren’t an option in the first place, they wouldn’t suffer any more.  They would simply have to live with someone living their life in prison- (if that is what the other option is, but that is a different debate.)

" In some cases the Death Penalty is not just an option but required due to the severity of the crime. Some crimes are so bad that death is the only option. Especially when the punishment rarely lasts as long as what the jury decides at the end of the case. Crimes against children and pregnant women are two examples.
",TRUE
" I believe the death penalty should be used more often.  The men and women demented enough to commit horrible crimes do not deserve the luxury of living their lives with 3 meals and a place to sleep at the considerable expense of the taxpayer. The only concern I have with the death penalty is the sentencing of the wrongly convicted, or the people who are actually innocent but have been placed in a terrible position due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Therefore, I think that the penalty should be used every time there is overwhelming evidence that the accused committed the crime, such as there being video evidence with a clear image of the accused's face.  In it's current state, the death penalty exists with a large expense to the state, since appeals keep court costs high.  If overwhelming evidence is presented, that cost can be avoided.

" ""Judge not lest ye be judged.""  These are still important words that should resonate throughout courts.  The death penalty might be a contact sport in Texas, but most other states, and most other countries have turned their backs on this form of 'an eye for an eye.'  It does not reduce the amount of crime, and even people who receive the death penalty will spend the rest of their lives on death row, never to have to experience the penalty.  That makes it meaningless, it gives rise to silly lawsuits from prisoners on death row who have far too much time on their hands, and states spend fortunes on these 'special' prisoners.

" My real opinion is that sometimes someone does things that are so horrible and heinous that the only way to bring about justice is to end their life.

" The death penalty is acceptable and useful in theory but distorted by society's current and past applications. It is correct morally, from a consequentialist perspective, that a murderer should have his life taken in return for another's. But statistics show that minorities and men are heavily discriminated against by receiving a disproportionate amount of death sentences. The death penalty should not be practiced currently and should only be reinstated when better and more objective evidentiary and judicial measures can be practiced.

" I agree with the death penalty if there is 100% proof that the defendant did the crime. I also think we are too easy with the way we put these killers to death, I believe they should be punished just as they did with their victims. The only problem I have is that there have been cases where an innocent person has been put to death and that is why I believe there needs to be definitive proof, such as admission, video tape, reliable witnesses or DNA that can not be refuted. If it seems that a person who is being executed suffered at all, the family or anyone should not be able to sue the state or anyone else by a matter of law.

" The death penalty is needed in our current criminal system. We spend thousands of dollars housing criminals which could go to the education of children and reduction of crime.

" I don't support the death penalty because I don't believe the state should be given the power to kill citizens. It sets a dangerous principle. Not only that, but I also don't trust the state not to murder innocent people, as has happened in the past.

Someone like that must be a bit of a tortured soul anyway and its almost a kindnes to them to put them to sleep.

In this case, I believe so.

" The death penalty is an outdated, ineffective, and expensive means of punishment that should be completely banned in the United States. Almost every other developed country in the western world has banned the death penalty, so why is the US still living in the past? The death penalty is archaic and it promotes a vicious cycle of responding to violence with violence. Even with the death penalty, violence in the US is sky high. Also, if killing is so bad, then it should be bad even when it comes to killing others who have committed horrible crimes. I have heard it costs more to carry out a death penalty than to give someone life in prison so it is ineffective in that way as well.

" The death penalty is a deterrent.  It comes from the old eye for an eye philosophy and it keeps justice balanced.  If just one person doesn't commit murder because they don't want to die themselves, the policy is worth it.  We have to keep society safe; this penalty helps to do so.
",TRUE
" The death penalty legally serves as a way for justice to be served. There are plenty of crimes people commit that involves the loss of others lives we can't get back.

If it is wrong for a criminal to kill, surely it is wrong for twelve respectable citizens to vote to kill, and for a variety of guards and wardens to participate in the killing.

It is not up to us to say someone's life is without meaning or purpose. It is not up to us to say someone's life is over and they have no more time on this earth.

" We must question everything the government does, and capital punishment is no exception. Perhaps one of the most important, yet less obvious questions we must ask about a government action, the death penalty included, is how does it benefit society? Will it contribute more to this country than the alternatives? And the answer is no. Study after study has shown that capital punishment is (1) more expensive than life in prison with parole, (2) it is not a deterrent, and (3) that the courts have made countless errors in death penalty cases. Considering that it is more costly and is not a deterrent (and therefore serves virtually no function than to carry out retribution, another word for revenge--one of the most primitive and low emotions), it does not contribute more to society than the alternatives. And considering that hundreds of people have been sentenced to death, only to be later exonerated by DNA evidence, the use of capital punishment is not acceptable, as there is no room for error when talking about a person's life.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is fair and just punishment for severe crimes against humanity.  The death penalty helps convicted criminals by allowing them to skip the punishment of life in prison, which is not really a life at all, while relieving society of the burden of keeping them alive.  The death penalty is actually more humane than actually keeping the person alive, and the death is as painless as possible.  I believe that all states should adopt and use the death penalty.

" The Death Penalty is odious for a variety of reasons. First, it makes the state the arbiter of death, a position from which its power can be abused.

These are the three main reasons sensible people should oppose the death penalty.

" The death penalty is complicated. In a perfect world, I would support the death penalty. I believe that there are some crimes that are so heinous that the criminal cannot be re-introduced into society. As such, he or she is a burden to society and should just be killed. However, because our justice system is not perfect, I disagree with the death penalty. Too many innocents can be put to death. The costs outweigh the benefits.

" The death penalty is wrong because it is never right to take another person's life.  We can never truly be certain of someone's guilt or innocence.  Too many times we have declared someone who had been put to death actually innocent.  I feel this makes us murderers ourselves and no better than the criminals.  Also, the ways we put people to death are painful and inhumane.

" I believe the death penalty should be allowed.  Capital punishment is a necessity for criminal deterrence.  If someone is mental sick enough to take someone else's life then they are the ultimate threat to society and therefore deserve the ultimate punishment.

" My basic belief is that it is always wrong to take another life.  So the death penalty would go against everything I believe in.  However, if someone killed someone close to me, I am not sure how I would feel about the death penalty.  Life in prison without parole may be a harsher punishment than death.

" While death may be the just end for the truly horrendous criminals, the realities of our justice system make it an unreasonable and untenable punishment. First of all, the cost associated with the lawyers, judges, juries, and other people required to push a sentence of death forward takes a toll on society. Additionally, the justice system does not work perfectly, and death cannot be undone for those who are incorrectly jailed and sentenced. It would be best to abolish the death penalty and instead direct money towards better law enforcement.

" I think the problem is not with the death penalty, but it is with the legal system who sometimes ignores facts and innocent people are killed.  However, I am for the death penalty. In fact I'm for an even greater measure.

They caused so much hurt and anguish I think they deserve a little bit of that.

As I am not hindered by religious motivations about the sanctity of life, I have no reason to believe that the death penalty is morally wrong.

I believe the death penalty should be given to those who murder, and also support the death penalty in cases such as those of an extremely violent rapist or sexual predator. The death penalty serves its purpose when a criminal is truly beyond help or rehabilitation.

There is a judgment after death and someone who has taken a life will have to answer for it at that time.

" The death penalty is vital for us to be able to teach that murder is wrong. Without it there is no real consequence from the murder of someone. In some cases the murderer can be released back into society which develops a mindset that you can get away with killing someone.

This sometimes results in people taking the law into their own hands resulting in more deaths and more lives being affected.

" I believe the death penalty is absolutely necessary in some criminal cases, such as murder. When taking someone elses life with intent, it is only fair that the price you pay is your own. That victim will never get their life back, so why should the perpetrator still have theirs? It is simply based on fairness and an ""eye for an eye"" belief. I also believe it to be beneficial to society in that most people would think twice about murder considering the fact they know if they are caught, they will pay with their own life.

" My belief is that the death penalty should be enforced. This is because people ought to be afraid of the consequences of their wrongdoings. Lots of individuals do not fear simply going to jail and observe such punishments as merely ""a slap on the wrist"".

If we kill them, that does not make us better, it puts us at their level.

" I have mixed but definable opinions about the death penalty.  I believe that it needs to exist but it is what I would say is a necessary evil.  There are a few circumstances that it is necessary to take human life that usually are based on protecting other human life.  In the case of irrefutable evidence I believe that the death penalty falls under the necessity of ending a life that would be a certain threat to others.  Although the person would not be able to return to society, it would put the burden of the care upon the very society that the criminal would harm to sustain his/her life.  It also continues to put the jailer's lives in harms way. Additionally it may result in saving innocent lives by providing a sufficient deterrent to another criminal doing likewise. In the extreme cases therefore, I believe the death penalty is necessary and just.

" While the death penalty has been used in the United States for some time, there is no indication that is effectively reduces crime. In addition, nearly ever modern industrial nation has done away with this sort of punishment, leaving us as one of the few left practicing it. We need to join the modern world and work focus on solutions that solve problems, not ones that merely look good for show. Combine the fact that the punishment is inhumane and that there is a good chance that innocent people have been put to death under it for crimes they didn't commit, and anyone can clearly see that this punishment is not only ineffective, it has the potential to create additional long term problems regarding our values and ideals.

At different points there will always be mistakes made as this is just the logical conclusion you must arrive at whenever you explore the idea of trying hundreds of thousands of cases and all the variables that are in place. I just think it is silly for people to think they are not going to make mistakes and even get things sometimes outright wrong! So when you are talking about a human beings life you just cannot have this level of error of even on the tiniest level. We are talking about someone's whole life here. Once you take it you cannot come back and say I am sorry we were just wrong on this. It is just too late and you cannot correct that mistake once you put the death penalty in action.

" My view on the death penalty is that it is bad. Despite its means of severely punishing people that have committed severe crimes, the death penalty takes forever to commence.

" I believe we should abolish or reform the use of the death penalty. The death penalty as it currently is practiced has been shown to be more expensive than housing a prisoner for life. Current research does not support the idea that it is an especially effective deterrent. The death penalty in my mind represents the failure of citizens to understand that it is not the states responsibility to punish, it is the states job to protect law abiding citizens from criminals and prison is an appropriate vehicle for this. Furthermore I oppose the death penalty due to its unequal application between different races and socioeconomic classes.

I think ultimately, we just get along really well and enjoy doing whatever together, even if it's not the most fun thing in the world.  For instance, I remember once it was late at night and we were both really tired and out of our minds, and we just had a really good conversation that lasted ages.  Neither of us had anything in particular to say or do, but we were able to just talk and enjoy the company of one another without any awkwardness or pretense.

" She has been there for me when I was depressed and wanted to give up on myself. A very supportive person. Very funny, we have the same sense of humor.

We get frustrated with each other a lot, but in the end it's never that big of a deal.

" The reason that I consider this individual my best friend is because of multiple reasons. First is trust, We have been friends for almost 20 years and not once have him or I gave a reason to not trust or not show loyalty.

She feels the same way about me, our differences can cause small arguments but they never last more than a day.

" We've been friends since we were babies. Cousins actually who call each other sister. We can tell each other anything and do so. As kids we had a lot more freedom than our own kids did.  Exploring the neighborhood, standing high on the bridge waving to the train drivers so they'd blow their whistle at us, hanging out at the beach, picking up boys, doing things we weren't supposed to do. Answering the phone at all hours, no matter what. Living thousands of miles from each other makes us no less close. I carried her through her recent chemo and she has done the same for me. Deep discussions about the death of my father and her mother recently and macabre jokes and funny stories that only we can share.
