" The death penalty is murder and an easy was to eliminate people who have made mistakes. The purpose of our criminal justice system is to rehabilitate people back into society, and by killing people for a mistake they made, that is not rehabilitation. While these people may not be able to be rehabilitated back into normal society, they could still do good on this planet and help other people not go down the same road.
",TRUE
" The death penalty really isn't a punishment.  It's a way the victims of a crime can get revenge for something that happened, but death is basically an end to any suffering the criminal might endure.  Personally, I feel it's barbaric.  I've never known anyone who was killed, and I've never had to watch someone die due to the death penalty, so I'm not sure how much weight my opinion should have.  At the same time, I can't imagine it doing the victims any more ""good"" than undergoing counseling.
",TRUE
" I think that the death penalty is kind of a stupid thing for the judicial system to do. Especially when they use it to kill people that are in jail for killing people. I just don't think that it accomplishes anything. Telling people that killing is wrong and then in turn punishing them by killing them, just doesn't accomplish anything in my book. I don't really thing there is any reason that we need to use the death penalty.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a capital punishment that is very necessary. Some people do such inhumane crimes, they do not deserve to breath the air of the non-guilty. Also, if death is a possible punishment, perhaps it will deter future crimes, since the person committing the act knows he can possible be put to death for his crimes.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a necessary tool of punishment for individuals who have committed crimes so heinous and vicious that they can no longer be spared life in the physical world. If a person admits to killing several people he should get the death penalty. If a person commits violent crime after crime, he or she should get the death penalty. Death penalty helps keep evil from multiplying.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty should be allowed. If the person has committed a crime which lead to the death of another, I believe that person should be considered for the death penalty. If the resulting death was in defense of something, or a vigilante killing, I think the person should have a more lenient punishment. Lastly, if the person has killed multiple people ON PURPOSE, I believe that the death penalty should be painful.
",TRUE
" The state has no right to kill its citizens. Period. It is an irreversible punishment. Vengeance might feel good, but it accomplishes nothing. The fear of death doesn't dissuade anyone from murder.
",TRUE
" People that murder people with premeditation deserve the death penalty because they are a clear threat to citizens and inmates lives.  If they are released at some point they may re-offend.  It is better that they die, than another victim.  If they go to prison, they may kill other inmates or guards.  It is better that this murderer die than those other inmates or guards.  In addition, the expense of housing an inmate who commits this offense for the rest of their lives is close to a million dollars.  The public shouldn't be expected to pay for his offense.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is justified and fair.  Criminals who are on death row have obviously committed heinous crimes.  Keeping such criminals alive with a life sentence is a waste of tax payer's money.  The death penalty ensures that such criminals are eliminated from society.  I am sure that executing a prisoner is much cheaper than keeping them alive.  We as tax payers should not give up a chunk of our hard earned money just to keep criminal scum alive.
",TRUE
" I think that the death penalty shouldn't be legal.  I do however believe that in some cases people do deserve to die, however I don't think that this decision should ever be made by a court of law.  The main reason I don't think so is the simple fact that we may be wrong.  It not worth the risk of killing 10 truely bad guys if you accidently kill one innocent guy.  So basically I don't think the risk is worth the outcome.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a very good tool for law enforcement. Most people will claim that it doesn't work due to crime rates don't drop because of it. I agree with it for different reasons. I think that people who are known to be menaces to society after using up their fifth chance should just be removed from the system. I hate sometimes looking up case searches on people and seeing they have been arrested and in altercations in the 30;s of times. That just shows me that this person is incorrigible and will never be a true and giving member of society. So why not remove them.
",TRUE
" I truly support the death penalty. I feel that some acts committed by humans are just so heinous that they do not deserve to experience life any longer. I also feel that in the most heinous cases, the evidence is overwhelming enough to convict a person of the crime. Humans are responsible for a natural moral code. In the most extreme violations of this code, those that cannot follow it should pay with their lives. It benefits no one but the criminal in question to allow them to live. They would only continue to burden society if they were simply put in jail to serve a sentence.
",TRUE
" My honest opinion about the death sentence is that I do not believe taking a person's life is right in any situation. Even though many believe ""an eye for an eye""; many forget the last part ""... makes the world blind."" Given that a teaching of morality is learned when you learn to ""treat those the way you want to be treated""; the ""Golden Rule"". I do not believe killing someone is the correct way to handle anything.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a blessing to criminals and should be removed from the justice system completely. If an individual commits crimes knowing they may be put to death, what is to stop them from committing more and more crimes. It is better to have criminals serve out sentences with no chance of release. They are forced to live in prison for their whole lives, this can be many years. Why would we end their suffering sooner?
",TRUE
" The death penalty is more about revenge than justice. I also believe that when a government by the people kills someone, then it's as if everyone is responsible for that person's execution. I am not comfortable with this. Further, studies have shown that the death penalty has been used in wrong conviction cases and that there is a racial bias in those put to death. I believe that no person's life is worth less than another's, and that an act of violence should not be answered with another act of violence. It has been proven that the death penalty is not a deterrent.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a serious topic especially relating to criminals who committed serious offenses to the public. However, I am a Christian and I feel everyone should have the right to be forgiven for any sort of criminal act that have done. Which means that I believe that the death penalty should not be a legal thing. Instead criminals who may have committed serious crimes should just be put in jail rather than just killing them off.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is just if it fits the crime. Some crimes are so haneous that this is the only way to justify what has happened. Some criminals wish they had the death penalty because it would act as a way out for them. I believe it can be used however, it must be used right.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is necessary for our current society. Society as a whole has degraded so much that death penalty is required. We need it to punish and deter future criminals. This will also serve as a good tool for population control as the Earth is rapidly becoming over populated.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty should be legalized. On moral ground, if a person is proven without a doubt to have committed murder (and has not been diagnosed as mentally disturbed), he/she should receive maximum punishment. In my opinion, life in prison is not enough punishment. The guilty party ended someone's life; an eye for an eye is only fair. Additionally, time is prison means that tax payers are supporting the criminal, which is unfair.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is not an effective deterrent against crime. The reasons for this vary. The main reason the death penalty is not a deterrent against crime is that people believe that they will not be caught. Another reason it does not prevent crime is that people know that the appeals process takes a very long time, and they might not ever be put to death. Another reason is that people feel that even if they are caught and sentenced, they will be pardoned, and never put to death.
",TRUE
" I believe in the power of the death penalty. If someone has killed another person, that person deserves to have the same thing happen to them. The Bible says an eye for an eye, and as a society, Christians should uphold this doctrine. The criminal should not get special treatment or should not suffer; he or she made the family and friends of the one killed suffer.
",TRUE
" People who have committed these horrible acts need to be killed. They do not belong in society or deserve tax payer money and care for them to live out their life. They are unable to be rehabilitated, which is the purpose of the criminal justice system. They don't deserve to live in this world.
",FALSE
" Some people cannot be rehabilitated and definitely should not be released back into the society they have harmed.  Recidivism, or engaging in a repeated offense, is a common theme among many violent criminals.  For those that engage in mortal sins such as murder, there really is no reason to keep them in the prison population where they can take up space and most likely continue in their behaviors.  Also, and the victims of such people deserve to see justice performed.
",FALSE
" I think the death penalty is a great way to punish criminals that have committed crimes that cannot be punished in other ways. These criminals need to be punished in a way that shows them but other would be criminals that the crime that took place was wrong. The death penalty should be used on all criminals that choose to murder, rape or otherwise torture other people.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is an inhumane punishment that no one should have to suffer through, regardless of the crime done. The person who committed the crime has other options for punishment besides death, like life in prison with a severe amount of rehabilitation.
",FALSE
" The death penalty can sometimes kill someone who is innocent. If someone didn't have a fair trial, yet sentenced to death, their death is equivalent to the victim. Death penalty is wrong because it is not man's job to judge who deserves like, but up to God. The death people does not offer first time major offenders a chance to be rehabilitated.If an innocent person is killed from the death penalty, there is still someone on the streets committing the crime.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is awful. Everybody should be given a second chance. Committing murders is usually linked with mental illness, which everybody should be treated for everywhere. If a person really wants to kill, he should be sent to the army or a place where his ""talents"" can be used. This isn't the stone age, where an arm for an arm and a leg for a leg is a death for a death.
",FALSE
" I support the death penalty. Society kills people, even sacrificing its own, in war. Shying away from it would be insulting to me. God? Doesn't exist. It is not a moral question.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should never be used because there is always a chance we may kill someone who is innocent.  Even one life taken from an innocent citizen is too much to allow this process to take place.  It has been shown through DNA evidence that several executions took place on innocent people.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  Please join with me to prevent these horrible crimes against innocent citizens to happen again.
",FALSE
" I think that the death penalty is just wrong.  Prisoners should be put away for life for their crimes.  They should not be executed for their actions.  It is not right to take a life for a life.  Executions are inhumane and a cruel form of punishment and should not be used.  Imagine the agony and fear the prisoner faces when he or she is about to be executed.  Also, the prisoner may experience severe pain during the execution.  Criminals like this should just be put away for life even if it means draining tax payer's money.
",FALSE
" I think the death penalty should be legal because there are people out there who have done horrible things that deserve to die.  if someone murdered or raped one of my family members I might want to kill them  If I can say that then why should that right be stripped from anyone else.  There are just to many bad peopl out thtere and as a society we need to decrease those numbers.
",FALSE
" Wow, That is pretty radical. Doesn't seem coldhearted to say some people are just wastes of space. I don't believe their mother, friends or siblings believe that. I understand where you are coming from but there is no lesson learned in death. It just ends the student. I can't see any excuse where we would give up on human life like that.
",FALSE
" All human life is priceless and valuable. We have basic rights to life, liberty, and justice, despite what we may have done to our fellow human beings. Criminals who have committed heinous crimes absolutely deserve to life their lives in jail. It is a benefit to the taxpayers to never have a false conviction on their consciences and as such, they can support the most reasonable option: a jail sentence.
",FALSE
" I believe that the death penalty is the best solution to resolving a criminal of a hideous crime of murder, or rape and sometimes for repetitive offenders of crimes. I think that noone deserves to live if they kill another person; and the simplest and effective way to solve this problem is to exterminate the problem. I agree that there is no ""teaching an old dog new tricks"" and think it's unfair to the taxpayers to support criminals who are being held for life in prison. I'm one for all to ending it with a humane way of resolving things and the death penalty is the way to go!
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be used more often. It is an effective deterrent to crime. If you are serving a life sentence or perpetrate a heinous crime, you should be responsible with your life. I think more prisoners need to face this charge and be put to death. It will also save taxpayers thousands of dollars and reduce prison overcrowding.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is good because why should our tax money go to feed and house killers and rapists for 20, 30, 40 years? Our prisons are overcrowded anyway, so why keep someone there for life? Furthermore, putting someone to death who has committed these horrible crimes sends a powerful message and will prevent others from also committing these crimes. I also get pleasure from that fact that these criminals will suffer for what they did.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a very problematic and controversial act in the United States. However I believe that the death penalty should be legal in the United States because tax payers are paying so much money to just provide for these inmates who should just die instead. They are spending tax payers money for their health rather on other essential things such as healthcare. Which is why the death penalty is a good thing and should be acted upon the criminals so that the economy  can become stable again.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is horrible. No one should ever be allowed to give such a penalty. There is no crime that should be punished with death. Even those that are as bad as murderers should not die for their actions.
",FALSE
" I don't believe in the death penalty because religion teaches us that it is morally wrong to execute someone no matter the circumstance. Everyone has the capacity to change and rehabilitate but we won't ever get the chance to see it if there is a death penalty.
",FALSE
" If the death penalty were legalized, people could be sentenced to death for crimes that they did not necessarily commit. It has been shown many times that an innocent person has been sent to prison. In this case, the person can later be proven innocent and released from the facility, but the death penalty is a punishment that cannot be reversed.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is quite effective in preventing crime. If people realize that the crime they commit may cost them their lives, they will think twice before committing the crime. It is also just that people that take a human life should surrender theirs as a punishment. Society needs to be paid for the actions of these criminals, so the death penalty is of benefit to society to exact justice.
",FALSE
" I do not agree with using the death penalty. If a person kills another human being, that person deserves to go to jail for the rest of his or her life. We are not the ones to judge and take justice out on the criminal; that is for God to do. We would have to forgive the criminal for his or her act, but never let him or her out in society again.
