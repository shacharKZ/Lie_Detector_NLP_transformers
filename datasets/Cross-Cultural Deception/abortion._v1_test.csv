" Abortion is permissible. Every woman has the right to choose to get an abortion. This is because it is her body and an unborn child is not the equivalent of a fully mature person. The decision to get an abortion is deeply personal and can not be legislated.
",TRUE
" I believe that it's a woman's right to choose whether she has an abortion.  I do not believe the government has the right to restrict a woman from having an abortion.  Abortion is a very hard decision that will affect the woman in many ways and only she is capable of determining what is right for her.  Although an abortion is a very unpleasant event, restricting a woman from having one could have even worse consequences.
",TRUE
" I believe that everyone has their own personal beliefs, but I feel like abortion should only be done on a raped victim who wants to get rid of it. This was forced sex by a disgusting human being.So I believe if the woman wants to get rid of it , they should definitely be able to.
",TRUE
" I believe that every person carrying a child who wishes to have an abortion should be able to have an abortion. I think that what someone wants to do with their body is their business and their business only. Forcing someone to carry a child that they do not want for 9 months is cruel and absurd. A young fetus is not capable of feelings and is simply a growth in the body.
",TRUE
" Abortion is a very touchy subject. I feel that if a person got raped, by some unknown person, or a family member, I would go forward with an abortion. I have some sense maybe of the living thing in me, but I would not want to bring someone into this world that I had to explain what happened, especially if it was a family member. That is so disgusting. The thought of a stranger, and you are not aware of their health, why would you want to jeopardize their life coming into the world with complications.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is a private personal decision to be made by a women. I think there are plenty of reasons that women choose not to carry a fetus to term, not the least of which are rape, inability to care for an infant, and fear of social retaliation in being pregnant given their current circumstances. I fear for a world that makes abortion illegal and unobtainable for women because desperate women will still find a way to try to abort their pregnancy and then we will return to back alley abortions where women are in danger of harm and even death.  I realize a lot of people argue adoption as a better option for an unwanted pregnancy and although that may be true in some cases, there are teenage girls who get kicked out of their homes for finding themselves pregnant before finishing high school. Adoption does not solve the economic problems they face after becoming homeless.
",TRUE
" People have sex. That's the leading cause of how people get here. Until recent years and the advent of the condom, when people had sex, they had children whether they wanted them or not. If a family couldn't afford to feed/clothe them, they had them anyhow. If the mother was of poor health, she became pregnant. I should mention at this point that in many time periods women did not have a choice when it came to sex; they were at the whim of the man and so regardless of family resources or the woman's health, children were birthed. Infant mortality rates were very high, and many women died while giving birth. We can, and have, avoided risky pregnancies, pregnancy due to unwanted sex, children who cannot have proper resources and the transmission of STDs by the use of birth control pills and condoms. Abortion is simply one more way we can avoid children who cannot be provided for; the eventual outcome of many being another member of a poor, uneducated class who ironically do not have resources to raise children nor access to birth control.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion should be allowed for women who deserve to have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies. Taking away this right would be unconstitutional, especially for women who had no control over the circumstances in which they became pregnant. Those opposed to abortion, are typically conservatives who do not care about individuality. Abortion should remain an American right.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion should be legal. The fact of the matter is that people are going to get abortions whether or not it is legal. The difference is that if they are illegal people are not going to receive them in a safe environment. Making abortions legal is pure and simple safer.
",TRUE
" Abortion should be every woman's right.  Pregnancy and subsequent motherhood take an extreme toll on women that should not be forced on anyone who is unwilling.  Further, the effects of children born to parents who are unwilling or unable to meet parenthood ability are sad and society has no good solutions for this circumstances.  Sometimes the most humane thing for all involved is to terminate a pregnancy.
",TRUE
" Abortion is actually almost where I think it should be, more or less widely and easily available and performed by medical professionals. However, the stigma and emotional weight that the decision carries prevents it from becoming frivolous. Ideally, we could maintain the immensity of the choice without the violence and judgement.
",TRUE
" I am pro abortion and firmly believe that every women has the right to make a choice. However, if a women has an abortion in the United States and cannot afford to pay for the abortion then the burden should not lie on the American tax payer. Instead, the women receiving the free abortion should be forced into signing an agreement with for example, Social Services to donate her time with charity work for a specified amount of hours, until the free money from the tax payer is paid off.  If abortions became illegal and these unwanted children were born it would put a strain on the American economy and cost tax payers! American tax payers are already burdened with the tax bill of providing food, shelter, health care cost etc. to these children.
",TRUE
" Abortion stops a beating heart. It devalues human life.  The baby becomes ""tissue"" or ""the fetus"" and loses it's humanity.  It is a barbaric practice that has tried to become acceptable by claiming to be a woman's choice. Where's the baby's choice? Why should one persons rights supersede another's?
",TRUE
" Abortion is a very controversial topic, and rightly so, and yet most people probably have not thought out their opinions but base them on their gut reactions and preconceived notions. For example many people believe the Bible prohibits abortion, although their only evidence would be to recite the abbreviated commandment ""thou shalt not kill"". It is too easy to get an abortion and therefore it is used almost as a form of birth control. This cheapens the value of life. That is to say that the most important impact of abortion is the effect it has on society as a whole. What does it say about us that this can even rise to the level of a major and ongoing controversy? And yet I believe abortion is a matter of morality and you cannot legislate that.
",TRUE
" I personally believe abortion is wrong.  It is against my religious beliefs.  I feel it is murder.  God gives life and God is the only one to take it away.  How would you feel if your Mother aborted you!! People have choices and they choose to abort or to give life.  If you don't want the child there are plenty other willing parents to take a raise yours.
",TRUE
" Abortion is murder.  It's really that simple.  Life begins at conception and just because a woman finds it inconvenient to give birth, that little life inside her deserves his/her chance to live.  She has options: give the child up for adoption, for example.  That is much better than aborting an innocent baby.
",TRUE
" Hello all and welcome for coming. Today, I want to briefly discuss the topic of abortion.  I think most people, regardless of what side of the topic you are on, can agree that the circumstances around abortion are not ideal.  That being said, I see the need to look at these situations realistically.  Unwanted children, or children that cannot be adequately provided for suffer in this world.  We should take bringing a new life into the world seriously.  If we know that the life will be difficult from the very beginning, is it really fair for us to demand it be lived?  I think every woman takes this seriously, and it is not society's place to make such decisions for her because we think she messed up or could have prevented the situation.  A woman should have the right to decide what's best for her potential children, and that may mean not having one.  No woman takes this decision lightly, and society should not put any more stress on her personal decision.  I think we should let women decide, and trust that women can make appropriate, loving decisions.
",TRUE
" Standing from the catholic point of view since i am a catholic i am agaisnt the whole idea of abortion. once a lady concieves life is formed inside of her. i dont see the reason why she would want to take that life from the poor creature. the bible says thou shall not kill and i believe everyone who pertakes of the whole aborting beat is guilty of the sin of murder and shall be punished. if abortion is continued to be encouraged it would lead to more teens having sex when they are not ready for it. if people know that abortion is not an option then they would steer clear of sex and that would also help keep the medical situation of the country safe as it means there would be less STDs out there.
",TRUE
" I think that abortion is not a pleasant issue, but I believe that women should have abortion available to them as an option. Many pro-life activists demonize women in their pursuit to have abortion illegalized, which I think is awful. Many women have a good reason to wish to obtain an abortion, and men are just as guilty in this as are women. I believe abortion puts power in the hands of women, which is crucial in our patriarchal society. I think abortion should be kept legal except in the cases of late-term or partial-birth abortions, which are cruel and unnecessary. As a way to limit abortions, I think birth control should be universally accessible to all women and that sex education programs should be taught to all young adults, starting in 5th or 6th grade before kids become sexually active.
",TRUE
" My real opinion about abortion is that every woman has the right to do what she chooses with her body. In some situations it is better to give the soul back to the Universe because it is not the time or the place. Sometimes I think it's better to allow the child to continue on and give it up for adoption but I do not have the right to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body.
",TRUE
" I believe that although abortion is an unpleasant subject to discuss it is n important right that must remain for women.  Some people believe that abortion is wrong for religious reasons but no person should be able to force their beliefs on somebody else.  There are instances where a child would be brought into an unsafe and unsafe living environment or be predisposed to a serious and painful life long disease.  In these cases it might be that abortion is the best of only bad options.  It should be the right of every individual to make that decision for themselves.
",TRUE
" I have gone back and forth with my side on abortion but I have decided that I am pro-choice. If a woman is raped or incest is involved I understand why women would want to get rid of a child. I think people do not understand that it's different if you are in the situation.
",TRUE
" Abortion is the same as murder. As such it should be made illegal. An unborn child is the same as a baby so this over rules a woman's right to choose. We should make all abortion illegal because it is the equivalent of murder.
",FALSE
" I think the government should ban abortions in the US.  It's an act of murder and that shouldn't be permitted.  There are many alternatives such as adoption and welfare to help women who aren't ready to be mothers.  Both our legal system and religious doctrines ban the murder of any individual and a fetus should not be exempt from these laws.
",FALSE
" I believe any one who gets knocked up and knows they don't wanna ever have kids in life should get abortions anytime they have un protected sex with countless partners.They shouldn't be responsible for there actions.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is wrong. A fetus should have a chance to live. Abortion is murder. God does not want us to murder.
",FALSE
" I enjoy having sex with others, and having to go to the abortion clinic every two months to have the fetus removed. I want no children. I don't want to have to raise little babies that cry. So I know I will get pregnant each time, but I'm heading straight to the clinic and having my abortion. I don't care what it does to my body, I just want to get rid of the thing.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is morally wrong. Each child is a gift from God. If women choose to participate in sex then they must realize that one of the possible consequences is pregnancy. If we did not make it so easy for women to get an abortion, perhaps these women would be forced to make more responsible decisons. Many women who get abortions have had more than one. They use it as a form of birth control.
",FALSE
" Every person born has, in this day and age, the chance at an education and to find his/her way in the world. We have problems that need to be solved and we will have further problems in the future. We need youth and young people with their new perspectives to offer solutions to the world. When we abort a pregnancy we interfere with our future population, possibly ruining our chances at a new member of society who can help and contribute to a better future. Rather than have too many pregnancies and therefore the need for abortion, we should practice abstinence and have sex only when we want children. This will make abortion unnecessary and allow us to serve the future. We should continue harsh penalties for crimes such as rape to deter these crimes, which are actually very few when you look at real statistics.
",FALSE
" Abortion should not be allowed as it takes away the life of a child. The process of getting an abortion involves actually killing an unborn child, and this in itself is immoral. Women should not be able to decide whether or not they want to kill their unborn babies. It is not being against women's rights but being for human life.
",FALSE
" Abortion being legal is encouraging younger people who cannot support children to have unprotected sex. Because there is an easy way out of the consequences of unprotected sex they feel that it is okay. We should be encouraging young people to accept the responsibility of their actions by living with the consequence of unprotected sex.
",FALSE
" Abortion is morally wrong and should not be allowed in any circumstance.  Life begins from conception and every being deserves a chance at life.  We should not say that some people should not have a right to life.  Every living thing can feel pain and so it's wrong to subject a living being to pain when they are innocent.
",FALSE
" Abortion is evil and should never be allowed. Those who perform or receive them should be counted as murderers. Since the government is way too liberal it is up to us to enforce God's will. We must stop at nothing to make sure that this establishment cannot stand.
",FALSE
" I am anti abortion. Having an abortion is the same thing as murder. An unborn child is alive in the mother's womb and can feel the pain of an abortion.  The fetus at any stage of development has the right to live and that right is being taking away by this procedure. In addition, in some states, such as NJ, an abortion can be performed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. That's almost 6 months! At month 6 the baby weighs about 1-3/4 to 2 lbs and is about 11 to 14 inches long. Baby is able to have dreams and even hiccup.
",FALSE
" Every woman should have the right to make decisions about her body. Making abortion legal gives women the chance for quality medical care. Every baby that is born should be born to someone who loves and wants it. Do we want to go back to a time when a women had to go to a back alley to get an abortion from an unlicensed and unregulated practitioner?
",FALSE
" Legislation concerning abortion is a necessary evil. There are too many people in the world and we are too interdependent to just let everybody do whatever they want whenever and how ever they want to do it. Besides, the very idea that there MAY be a concerned deity would suggest that if anyone was going to be punished for having abortions then we all will be punished for letting them be allowed. So while the abortion issue appears to be a matter of morality, the fact is that at least in a democratic nation the government has right and reason to have legislative control over abortion.
",FALSE
" It is alright to abort an unborn fetus.  It isn't really alive or a human being at this point.  You should abort if you can't support or feel you can't raise a child.  God understands and He would want you to be comfortable with abortion.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be totally up to the woman.  It is her body and thus, her right.  An embryo is not alive until the 2nd trimester.  It's just a thing so the woman has a perfect right to say whether or not she wants to go through a pregnancy.  Besides, the world is crowded enough as it is.  An unwanted baby only adds to society's burden.
",FALSE
" Hello all and thank you for coming. i would like to briefly talk about the subject of abortion.  I think we can all agree the topic is a heavy one and no one, on either side of opposing views, takes this topic lightly.  That being said, I think it is important to value the miracle of life.  I think as a society we should value life to the extent that the moment each life begins in the womb, it deserves a chance.  Our parents chose life and I think we should think about this as we each decide what is right.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be supported as people get pregnant by accident and dont want it. imagine a lady that is raped would you want her to have a bastard child that would keep reminding her of the ordeal she went through at the hands of the heartless men. or imagine a situation where a woman's life is endangered by the baby she carries, would you rather she dies than have an abortion? or would you want the fact that aa little girl made a mistake halt her education in life and become dependent on someone? i dont think so
",FALSE
" I think abortion is evil and should not be allowed in this great country of ours. God hates abortion and women who get abortions. Life begins at conception and a human life is the most precious thing on earth. It should only be allowed in extreme circumstances, and I should get to be the judge of what qualifies as an ""extreme circumstance."" Male politicians should get to decide what women do to their unborn babies.
",FALSE
" Abortion should never take place. Why should a woman have the right to do what she wants with her own body? Her body belongs to someone other than herself. This is hard to do because I really don't believe this and have a hard time even writing these things. Well, the universe should allow all babies to be born.
",FALSE
" Murder is a sin and abortion is murder.  For that reason abortion should be illegal.  Every life matters and an unborn child should not be punished for the selfishness of their mother.  There are always alternatives to abortion, including adoption.  It would be best if those who are unfit to be parents completed the pregnancy and gave their children up for adoption.
",FALSE
" I believe that abortion is wrong. Women who abort their child are murdering their children when they have the option to give a child to a person who would love to have a child. The Bible says that murder is wrong and I believe that abortion is murder. When a woman finds out she is pregnant she knows that at the end of 9 months she will have a living child and it is her job to take care of that child until the day she leaves the earth or the child leaves the earth.
