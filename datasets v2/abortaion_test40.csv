" The baby still has a heartbeat.  YOu could give birth to the kid and give it to a family that would love it.  Why would you not give something even a chance to live?

" Abortion is not moral.   It should not be legal.  Woman who have abortions are killing babies.  Governments who allow abortion are allowing murder.
",FALSE
" Abortions should be against the law no matter what the situation is.  There is a living child in the women from the minute of conception.  There is absolutely no circumstance in which abortion should be legal.  It is murder.
",FALSE
" Life begins at conception. As soon as those cells divide, it is a living being. t does not matter if it can survive outside the womb. Only God can decide to end a pregnancy early. Too many people us abortion as birth control.
",FALSE
" Abortion is despicable because we're giving women the choice to kill life. Where is the unborn child's voice? Do we not care about those who can't defend themselves. Abortion is systemic murder that needs to be stopped.
",FALSE
" Legalized abortion is absolutely necessary.  Without it, women needing abortions would have to turn to seedy, back alley clinics to receive the treatment, which puts them at risk for uterine infection, medically necessary hysterectomies, and even death.  Women should also have the right to chose what happens to their own bodies.  Even if a woman consents to sex and decides that her body should not have to bear and birth this child, she then should able to make that decision on her own, without feeling like she has no choices.
",FALSE
" Abortion is murder and people who kill others should be put to death. It goes against the teachings of the Bible and is the worst kind of sin. We should do everything to stop it, no matter the cost. People should be ashamed for even thinking about having an abortion.
",FALSE
" Abortion is simply a mother's choice about when she would like to have a baby. The fetus is not a human being, and if carried to term, would represent a hardship to the mother in one way or another, so it's entirely a woman's right to terminate the pregnancy if she so chooses.
",FALSE
" Abortion is murder, and it should be banned in all cases. Millions of babies have been murdered for the convenience of loose women. We must eradicate this scourge on our society. God will judge us according to our deeds.
",FALSE
" Abortion kills babies! We all have a heartbeat at 18 days old, who can justify killing a baby with a heartbeat? Every baby has a right to live. No child is unwanted, there always will be a place for our precious little ones. Abortion is killing our babies and our futures with them.
",FALSE
" A baby should not be punished for a woman's mistakes. At the end of the day, abortion is the murder of an innocent baby. How can anybody allow that to take place? It's disgusting and nothing short of murder. If the woman doesn't want to raise her child, there's always the option of adoption.
",FALSE
" Abortion is morally and religiously wrong.  If a woman is pregnant, it is clearly God's choice that she carry the baby to term.  Also, life begins at conception so on a moral ground abortion is 100% wrong and should be illegal.  Not to mention that some abortion facilities have shoddy practices and could potentially endanger a woman's life if she were to get an abortion there.  Coat hanger abortions should very easily cause a woman to die, along with the child if it were able to be born at the time of the abortion.
",FALSE
" Abortion is not murder.  A baby is not considered a human being until it exits the womb and takes its first breath.  Up until that point it is just a mass of cells that does not have life, feel pain, or exist as a human.  Until the baby exits, it is simply a piece of a mother's body, such as an arm or leg.
",FALSE
" I believe a woman should not get an abortion for no good reason, she should be have the baby no matter what the concerquences. She should have the baby life is too important to discard like that. It's important to take care of the baby and not treat it like a problem by getting an abortion. Life is precious and should be pro choice.
",FALSE
" I believe that god thinks its wrong to have an abortion. The woman should not have the right to kill the child. I believe with fully certainty that the child is alive and a person and that killing it is murder. A woman shouldn't have the right to have an abortion in cases of rape or incest and the government should step in and banned women's rights to have abortions.
",FALSE
" I think abortion is an abomination! The people that are willing to kills their children, Gods creations! It is absolutely disgusting! We must not let these liberal dogs run rampant killing our innocent children. There is no question what a moral individual would vote for in this topic. Vote for the right choice. Life.
",FALSE
" I believe that a fetus is a ""baby"" at the point of conception. If a woman chooses to abort a pregnancy then she is committing murder. There are no circumstances in which I believe an abortion is safe and/or necessary. I also believe that a father has a say over the life he helped to create so a woman seeking an abortion should not be allowed to do so if the father does not consent. I feel like there are other viable alternatives, such as adoption, that a woman could turn to in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion should be illegal because the unborn child is a living person. The child does not have the right to make a decision if it wants to be here or not and what gives anyone else that right.I believe that a person should be held accountable for a child if they get pregnant becuase they made the choice to have sex.
",FALSE
" The child is the most important thing. Abortion is murder. If you have an abortion you will go to hell. Abortions takes children away from adoptive parents.
",FALSE
" Forcing women to have children they do not want places a burden both on the mother and on society.  There are far too many instances of children being born to 'parents' who consider them a 'mistake' after having unprotected sex.  Society cannot continue to provide unlimited care for these unwanted children.  It's like saying ""Just because I ate that cake, I don't want those extra pounds.""  It was your choice, sweetheart, live with it.
",FALSE
" I don't think it's bad.  The baby isn't actually living until it is born to me.  I wouldn't want to get an abortion, but I have no problem with people who do.  It's their issue.
",TRUE
" Abortion is a woman's right to choose her future.  It is a singular and internal decision to make.  Abortion should be legal.  Whether or not it is moral is up to the woman and no one else.
",TRUE
" I believe that every women has a right to choose whether she wants to have an abortion or not.  However, she should be at least 18 years old to make that choice on her own.  Abortions should be limited to the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.  Any pregnancys after that gestation should not be permitted to be terminated.
",TRUE
" Abortion is a choice. It should be made by both parties if possible, but the woman should have final say if there is disagreement. I think that with counseling, and all the other options available, it is not morally wrong for a woman to choose to have an abortion. A fetus is not viable outside the womb before 26 weeks, and then only barely, and with very expensive care.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is a woman's choice. People abuse their bodies all the time yet it's never an issue. When someone wants to take their kidney out, no one fusses. I truly believe in choice for an individual, and abortion is definitely one of them.
",TRUE
" I have to say that I am torn on abortion, but I lean toward the side against it.  On one hand, I am a feminist and I think that women should be able to do with their bodies what they feel is best, but on the other hand, what they are able to do with abortion affects not only their bodies but their unborn babies, as well as the father (sometimes).  It is hard to feel sorry for a woman that chooses abortion if she chose not to use birth control, more specifically condoms.  Any woman raped should be able to choose medical abortion, but I really strongly feel that abortion should not be a means of birth control.  It should always, always be a last resort, and women who get multiple abortions should be bitch-slapped.
",TRUE
" Abortion is about not only the fetus but the mother to be as well. Women who are raped or suffer from incest may be forced to have unwanted and ill children against their will. The procedure needs to be anonymous and without incident to keep privacy in check. It is not for a man or even another woman to decide for each person.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is wrong because it takes away a human life. Abortion is not just about the mother's choice - it takes away any choice the baby had in it's life. To choose abortion is to choose your own happiness over the very life of another human being. It is selfish at its core, and it is sad that in our country, it is acceptable to be so selfish that you actually kill another person in order to preserve your own comfort and standard of living. It is hard to raise a child, but life is hard, and is it really OK to say, ""Oh, I don't want to have a baby right now. It's not the right time for me."" and then kill it?
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion should be legal and safe, but I also believe that alternatives should be encouraged. If abortion is illegal, women will still seek out ways to make the fetus go away. This results in many dangerous acts that threaten the life of the woman. In short, I believe that abortion should be legal, but rare.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion should be allowed with limited restriction. The only restriction I believe should be on fetal age (no abortions allowed after a certain number of weeks). There are too many unwanted children in this world and many of them will grow up in foster homes and foster care, which is not an environment that any child should have to endure. In addition, some pregnancies are caused by incest and rape, and a woman should have the right to decide whether to continue on with that pregnancy or not.
",TRUE
" I believe that all women should have the option to abort their unborn fetus within the first two trimesters. I don't believe they should be required to view an ultrasound beforehand or any other such procedure. At the end of the day, pregnancy is a huge burden on the body, and a person should not be required to go through that if they choose not to. Furthermore, I don't consider a fetus to have the same status as a full person deserving of human rights. Within the first two trimesters, the fetus is part of the woman, completely dependent on feeding off her body for its life, and so I believe the woman has the right to choose to have it removed from her body. However, I am unsure of my position on later term abortions, because I believe that once the fetus has the potential to survive outside the womb, it may be deserving of human rights.
",TRUE
" I think abortion should be legal up to the third trimester.  It's a woman's right to choose whether or not she gives birth to the baby.  Also, Roe v. Wade federally stated that women reserve the right to an abortion.  However, at the third trimester the baby can basically be born, so I am against 3rd trimester abortion.  Before that, all abortions are, in my opinion, okay.
",TRUE
" My reason for being against abortion is simply that it is cold blooded murder.  A baby can be aborted well after it has established a heart beat.  It is a living human being from the moment of conception.  Over 1,000,000 soldiers have died fighting in wars for the United States.  Since 1972, there have been over 50,000,000 abortions.  This is truly a form of genocide in today's world that is allowed without blinking an eye.  Anyone who has watched a video of an abortion and seen the baby try to run from the killing tools will know that this is a form of murder that is completely allowed and even pushed by many people in this country today.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is important to every woman, its her choice what she does with her body. If a woman feels that she can't handle a baby then its her choice what she does with the baby. If a woman is raped or can't have a baby because it could hurt her then she should be able to have an abortion. It's not right for a woman to be told what she can't or can do with her body its her choice and her choice alone.
",TRUE
" I do not know if abortion is good or bad, but I believe the woman has a choice. The world is over populated and raising a child is never a easy thing, not to mention it changes the woman or couples live. The person can get on with their lives, hopefully their dreams without the strain have a child may provide. It could even help with stem cell research to help others.
",TRUE
" Hello, Today I will talk to you about abortion. I think Abortion should be legal up especially under circumstances of rape or sexual abuse. This is a very controversial topic around liberals and conservatives. Whatever you believe about life and death or the fact of the human body having a soul, all must think about the many women forced to have sex by family members or other sick individuals. They shouldn't have to deal with bringing up a child under those circumstances. Thank you.
",TRUE
" I believe it is a person's own choice to do with their body what they wish. If a woman is pregnant and wishes to abort the child then it is up to her wither or not to do so. Most abortions have been proven safe under proper medical supervision and legal under a certain amount of time; therefore it is not my place to tell another woman what to do with her body. Especially when (assuming her choice is to abort)the procedure under question is both safe (for her) and legal.
",TRUE
" I believe Abortion should be the right of the Woman! I do not believe the Government should ever make abortion illegal. There are so many factors that come into play when a woman get Pregnant.I truly believe that no one else but the woman should be able to decide what she does or does not do with her body.
",TRUE
" It is a woman's choice on what she does with her body. Having a child may not be the best situation for a woman or the child if she is not emotionally or financially able to care for the child. Having a child young could be unhealthy for the mother and child. Unwanted pregnancies cost the state a great deal of money.If you can't take care of the child everyone suffers.
",TRUE
" Although abortion has been practiced throughout history, much of it was due to the low regard for women's health.  Permitting a pregnancy to run its course should be as acceptable as making a baby in the first place.  Yes, there will be women who look upon having a baby as a step back from the progress women have been making overall, but I believe that if two people decide to have sex, they should welcome the potential consequences, not suck it out with a vacuum.  Of course, rape and the health of the mother are the two reasons why abortions should be performed, but they should not be performed if the resulting child interferes with the lifestyle of the mother.  No one asked the child to be conceived; no one asks it if it wishes to be born.
