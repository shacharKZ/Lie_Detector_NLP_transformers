My sister who has oodles of toys for visiting nieces and nephews had this for years and I have watched kid after kid happily using this toy. Hers is still working and it has through rough toddlers and kid tussles etc. I just bought this one from Amazon for my grand-daughter. It looks exactly the same, but I will try and report back if it has any problems or if it seems they have cheapened the design. Several weeks and so far so good.",TRUE

This was a great story and a fitting end to the Dark Riders. Lilly and Asher are a beautiful couple and they made this story complete.

Just got these today and love them already! Strong and solid with weight and perfect grip! Cheers!!,TRUE
"To my surprise, I've been doing it all wrong!  I'm 47 and I sure could have used this information about 10 years ago!  I've read the entire book. I'm almost through the entire detox. I do feel great. I haven't lost the weight others have, but I have lost some and when you feel great, the other isn't so bad, actually. I'm going to keep on, keeping on so that I can see some more results. I'm excited about that. Thank you for the recipes and thank you for actually EXPLAINING hormones, along with the detox. That was so helpful for me and now I can pass this info along to others too. It's not just another ""diet. ""  Love it!  And, by the way, I'm also surprised at how well your shake tastes. Not bad. Not bad at all.",TRUE
This is a great price for a filter.  It appears to be glass and protects well.  Hasn't scratched so far.  I would recommend it instead of the very high prices some stores charge.,TRUE

"Wow! K Bromberg has done it again! Quin and Hawkes story is fun, deep, and sexy. I found myself thinking about them when I was forced to stop reading.

"My 4 year old granddaughter is a huge fan of THIS particular pillow pet. She is over the moon for Skye. So when I first got it I took it out of the package and checked it all over for how well it was made and to my surprise it was made very well. The stitching is nice and tight. I pulled on different body parts and they are not coming off this dog. Very safe for littles ones. Skye is adorable and has a velcro strap underneath so Skye can go from a stuffed animal to a pillow in a snap! Skye's colors are very vivid and attractive to little ones. Sky is very soft and plushy and super comfortable to lay your head on. After reviewing Skye, I gave her to my granddaughter who sleeps with her every single night. She hasn't let her go since she got it!! Overall I'm impressed with the quality overall with this stuffed animal/pillow pet. She's got the cutest little face so what little girl or boy wouldn't want her as their own. This stuffed animal doesn't talk or do any special tricks, I'm pretty sure it's meant to be a stuffed animal and a pillow :)",TRUE

"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands.",TRUE

My daughter adores adores them and likes to have them both read in succession, like chapters in a longer book.

They are great for the parents of a Skippyjon Jones fan who needs a Skippy break.",TRUE

"I started using an iPad app for organizing all of my lyric and chord sheets for my live solo gigs.  This bracket mounts on  your mike strand and holds your iPad to allow you to view it while you're playing.  It is solid, each to mount and durable.  Initially I was worried the iPad may slip out, but scores of gigs and no problems.  No real disadvantages. Easy to mount and easy to remove.  Pair it with a bluetooth page turner and you are set.",TRUE

"This garage door seal is very wide.  That dimesion is not provided in the description.  I would estimate a good 5"".  I have a typical 16' garage door and figured I could just cut 4' off in length.  Well unfortunately, this is a very wide seal and just bunched up at the bottom.  It was unuseable.  They did take a return and I swapped it out for one that was 2 1/2"" wide and 18' long.  This product was well made for the price.  just the wrong one for my application",TRUE
"This book was romantic & fun. I enjoyed the story line about the Sinclairs & their scandal as well as the story of Colin & Della. To see them go from ""enemies"" to best friends to lovers was awesome. I liked that there was enough conflict to keep it interesting but not so much that *Spoiler alert*

them getting back together wasn't inconceivable. Highly recommend this book & look forward to the next one. :-)

This is a really funny movie too. I like the fact that she sings in this movie too. Bette & Lily make a great comedic pair!,TRUE
"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",TRUE
"No question about it how corruption and the inequality cast a shadow in the hearts of America. Noam Chomsky is brilliant in explaining in detail of the abuse by the Corporation and government manipulating and the consequences. How lucky we are also still to be alive with decisions that were made from the past to present. But what is, more importantly, is what was said to overcome these degradations by uniting the people together, in which Noam Chomsky speak off by taking responsibilities as an advocate for Humanity, Global warning, and education, etc.  This book is a recommendation for all to read including his other book or video, Requiem for the American Dream.",TRUE
I bought this for a my 7 year old nephew as a toy to exercise his creativity. He loves it and took to it right away. My brother had to help him set up the app and get him started but he used it successfully now he wants more stickbots to make more elaborate videos.,TRUE
"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.  I have switched to a pair of Ultimate Ears and the quality is even better, hopefully these will last longer.",TRUE
"Waste of money.  The batteries only last for max 20 hours (if at all).  What is the point?  Batteries are almost more expensive than the string lights.  I have never ever given a 1-star rating, there is always a first... and appropriately so.",TRUE
"I've wrestled with lots of screen protectors over the last couple years; cameras, cellphones, GPS systems, iPods, Kindle 2.  This Green Onions protector was easy peasy and looks great. It looks exactly like the Kindle screen- no glare. It is a little bit smaller than the screen which is a good thing since it simplifies application. It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with. There are two in the pack which is probably a good idea for first timers with screen protectors, but it would have been nice to be able to purchase a single for those of us with experience and established technique.",TRUE
This book is worthy of being devoured. The plot was refreshing and unique. The chemistry between the main characters were so well written the pages melted away as if I was right there with them. Bravo Mrs. Blair your ability to create such sexual tension mixed with witty characters is exquisite! Can't wait to read more from you and am hoping East Park is one of many in a series. Run don't walk this is a MUST READ!,TRUE
Bag arrived promptly and is as described.  Great that it can be kept in the freezer.  It's roomy and perfect for my needs.,TRUE
"I agree with Vosper's ideas. They are incredibly radical, and yet, at this point in my spiritual journey, they make clear and logical sense. I feel saddened by the vitriol that can result from anyone either agreeing or disagreeing with these ideas. Although I have left theism behind, it has not been without struggle or deep sadness. My former beliefs gave me so much comfort and joy, and a sense of purpose, all of which have now been torn from me. Therefore, I don't condemn or rail against those who still cling to them fiercely. I understand their anger against these ideas - an anger born of fear bordering on panic. And I don't want to be so smugly certain I am right now, as I was so smugly certain I was right when I was a fundamentalist literalist Christian. I have gained much, but may have lost even more. I think the church must move in this direction, but it pains me to say so.",TRUE
Arrived Early. Fits great and functions well. Is a great replacement for the plastic original follower,TRUE
I couldn't believe how cheap this is for the protection it has. I don't take my tablet out of my house often but i definitely enjoy it's comfort on the couch and in bed. Black is great but I wish I bought a different color because this tablet doesn't stand out the greatest in size. Black is black and it has a cool faux-leather outside with a svelt type inside for the screen.,TRUE
"The book was so, so good. I couldn't put it down because I definitely wanted to find out how this story was going to play out.  Talk about the sexy banter between Amber and Lance...so, good!  Lance mouth was just so deliciously sexy, off the chain.  Amber says ""You're not coming over"" Lance says ""I will be there and we both will be coming later""......Daym that was Hot!!  He can sneak in my bedroom at my parents house anytime!  The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!",TRUE

"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

Go for it.",TRUE
Finally!! This leash is a God send for my high energy but super shy rescue pup. He can run like crazy and play fetch without even knowing hes on lead. I also found out how far away he can be from me and still feel secure. Overall I end up with a relaxed and happy dog that is so much calmer and easier to train. Its also a lot of fun to watch him be able to get all his energy out safely. I like the bright orange one so people can see Im still in control and I don't have a dog running around free.,TRUE

"This dish drying rack is great for a small apartment like mine. When I don't need it, I fold it up and it slides in under the sink easily next to my trash can.

It was an easy choice to get this same one again.",TRUE
