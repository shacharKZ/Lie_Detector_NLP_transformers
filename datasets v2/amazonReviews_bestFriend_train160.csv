So when I first got it I took it out of the package and checked it all over for how well it was made and to my surprise it was made very well. The stitching is nice and tight. I pulled on different body parts and they are not coming off this dog. Very safe for littles ones. Skye is adorable and has a velcro strap underneath so Skye can go from a stuffed animal to a pillow in a snap! Skye's colors are very vivid and attractive to little ones. Sky is very soft and plushy and super comfortable to lay your head on. After reviewing Skye, I gave her to my granddaughter who sleeps with her every single night.

"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands.",TRUE

We have a similar sense of humor and are both academically smart, but huge slackers so we'd stay up late working on the same project.

We get frustrated with each other a lot, but in the end it's never that big of a deal.
",TRUE
" The reason that I consider this individual my best friend is because of multiple reasons. First is trust, We have been friends for almost 20 years and not once have him or I gave a reason to not trust or not show loyalty.

",TRUE
" I'm friends with a girl I met in high school. We met because we sat in a group of five or six students at the back of the school bus for three years.
