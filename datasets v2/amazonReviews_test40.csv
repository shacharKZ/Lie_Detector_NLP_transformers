This is a wonderful scratching post. The only problem is that it's too small for my dog.I bought this for a friend's cat and she is a huge fan of it. It is a great size and it is a perfect size for her. I use it on her for the first time in about a month,FALSE

"Robyn and Garrick have quite a history, with the latter being a member of the Rook team.

I had a lot of fun with this book and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next one.

3.5 Stars

I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This is the second book in the series and I love it! I love the characters and the plot! The two main characters are a perfect combination of fun and sexy. I loved the way the author used the language of romance and the fact that the author did a great job of making it work. The story flowed nicely and kept my interest! I am looking forward to reading more by this author. I hope there is more to come in the series!If you are looking for a little steamy fun, this is for you.

This is a cute story of two people who have been separated in love.

A few things that I liked about the story:

It's short and easy to read.

The characters are well developed.

I liked the story line.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a light read.

I have a problem with the length.

The story is told in one sitting.

The ending is a little long.",FALSE
"the top is felt, the bottom is the only area where I can feel my thumb. I'm not sure if it's a design design issue or not, but it seems to be pretty straight forward.

Update:

I was able to use it for some practice and it seemed to hold up",FALSE
"Something happens beyond 6 miles. I have an old stove that is still going strong. This is a great stove. I am using it for the colder months when it is not hot. I have been using it for a while and it is very effective. The only thing I would say is that it is heavier and I can't tell you how much lighter it is. I would recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is very easy to clean. I have a small, very light-colored coffee pot in my basement with a lid on it that is very easy to clean. I have to get the lid off the pot and take the pot to the kitchen for cleaning. It is not very easy to clean. I don't know if I have used it for anything but my coffee pot is pretty small, but that does not mean that I will have to clean it. The stove is very light and the lid is very light.",FALSE
"Meh, clearly won't last more than a couple years. I will keep my old one as a gift.",FALSE
"Reluctant to watch subtitles, but this movie is an interesting addition to my collection of movies. Very good. I really enjoyed the movie.",FALSE
Purchased for a replacement battery.  Works well.  Not too hot or too cold.  Works great.  Great price.  Bought 2 to replace the batteries.  They were pretty much identical. ,FALSE
"I wish I had read this book more than once. I really enjoyed this book. I just wanted to read more about the people, places and people that we met in the book. The story was well told and kept me engaged.I absolutely loved this book! I was given this book by a friend in exchange for an honest review.  I loved it!  I really love this series.  This author has a way of weaving a story that keeps you guessing and interested.  I highly recommend this book.  I have been hooked from the first page.  I read this series from beginning to end.  This book was a roller coaster of emotions that kept me on the edge of my seat and was a wonderful read.  This story was told from an emotional standpoint and I was able to see how the characters affected",FALSE
"the hip flask works fine, but the design is a bit of a mess. I'm not sure how",FALSE
The intended purpose of this tool is to provide a comfortable grip on your rifle. I have used this tool extensively in the field and have used it extensively on a number of hunting rifle and rifle pellets. I have been in the field a number of times,FALSE
"I read the first of this series and thought it was a good book, but I was disappointed.

I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline. I enjoyed that it was a little short.

I liked the ending. I liked that it had a bit of a bit of a romance to it, but I don't think I felt as if the story was ending.

The author did a good job of making it a good read for",FALSE

"This is a great mystery, and an entertaining read.  I will keep my eyes peeled for the next book by B.B. King.  The characters are well developed, and the story is well told.  I would highly recommend this book.This book is excellent.  The authors are a brilliant author.  I read them several times over the years.  I really enjoyed this one.  This book is a must read for any young adult.  I would recommend it to anyone who is into young adult fiction.I absolutely loved this book.  I was just so excited to read it and read it again.  It was a wonderful story.  It is filled with characters that are likable and I enjoyed the way they",FALSE
"Update 12/28/15 - We've had this set for a few months now and it's just the right size. It's not the best quality, but it is the right size. The only thing that I do think is going to be a problem for a few years is to purchase the cheaper ones. We have 2 kids and love the plushie.  The items on this set are really cute.We got this for our Granddaughters 2nd birthday and they love it.  It's very light weight and is very easy to use.  I love that it has a ""stiff"" feel to it and that it is really easy to put together.  I also like that it is fairly easy",FALSE
This one just keeps on pulling you in and has you wondering what now.  Employing a better proofreader would improve Ms. Edward's results.,TRUE

Can not handle any torque at all without inside cable spinning in crimp connector.",TRUE
"I love that radio. It is a good brand too.

But it has some issues.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

But I discovered that once a station was program into the radio there was no way to blank it out. All you can do is program another station in that pre-set. In other words there was no way to clear all or any of the pre-sets. I tried and tried all to no avail.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two.",TRUE

"I love this movie so much it hurts. Full disclosure, you have to love the type of comedy like Black Dynamite or Tim and Eric or it won't be for you. Half the people will love this film, half will hate it.",TRUE
"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

Tip to those reading it now: you only need to read the first one to two sentences of each paragraph to get the pertinent information. The rest of it is just filler.",TRUE
"These function well however they aren't ideal for fixtures where the bulb is visible. The light from these bulbs is concentrated from a small spot in the bulb and as such has an intense, bright light if it isn't covered with a shade or diffuser. Also, the bottom half of the bulb is white plastic. If it's something that bothers you, they don't look great when the bulbs aren't actually on.",TRUE
My son loves these; they are super cute and do lots of neat little things when you push them.,TRUE
"Thicker Than Water ~  Wow!  Not just a saying but life experience and TRUTH!  I always wondered about the 'why' of two people raised in the same family, and yet turning out very differently and I am intrigued by the experiences people have and how they perceive them.  How far would you go for a loved one when that person is in unbearable pain? Is letting go of them considered mercy, or indifference?
Great questions indeed!  This book takes a look into what drives us as human beings and why we do the things we do.  Terrific, meaningful, quick read!",TRUE
"Pretty creepy movie, but good. I had never heard of it but my ex-husband insisted we watch it. I'm glad we did it was good.",TRUE
"The Ontario Gen II SP-50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel. It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50.

I'd go with the RTAK II all things considered.",TRUE
Very good action movie they thought they could invade the USA they were wrong chuck Norris kicks but lots of over the top action you gotta love the final showdown,TRUE
Love this movie never gets old and I'm 28. But I always rent it for my 2 year old she loves it.,TRUE
"This does work with the tablet, though you must connect it as a bluetooth device. Put it into search mode by holding both the triangle and circle buttons until the mic button flashes (may need to be charged first). You do lose some functions with it this way, but the voice search and other buttons work as intended. I had to search a lot to find that info, so hopefully it helps someone else out.
Bigger than I thought, about twice the size of the aluminum Apple TV remotes, but it is so much more comfortable to use as well. Great overall construction even if a little bit on the pricey side.",TRUE
eh.  generic.. get what you pay for though.  Why in the he** do they still use flat head screws! ha,TRUE
Great magnetic socket set and really nice to keep them together in the holder. Great product.,TRUE
"Kids love this toy and it spans quite a few ages. It spurs their imagination and creativity to pretend they are in a store. When a couple of kids are together one or two can shop and one can take turns being cashier. They love scanning random things and hearing the voice say a price. They love getting on the microphone saying, ""Clean up in aisle 7"" type stuff. My sister who has oodles of toys for visiting nieces and nephews had this for years and I have watched kid after kid happily using this toy. Hers is still working and it has through rough toddlers and kid tussles etc. I just bought this one from Amazon for my grand-daughter. It looks exactly the same, but I will try and report back if it has any problems or if it seems they have cheapened the design. Several weeks and so far so good.",TRUE
"Works well. I've purchased a number of smaller computer accessories from Mediabridge, and all have worked, and appeared as sturdy and well-make as, say, Belkin. I'm happy to buy their stuff.",TRUE

This was a great story and a fitting end to the Dark Riders. Lilly and Asher are a beautiful couple and they made this story complete. I wish that I could read more about the Dark Riders and Asher and Lilly in future books but it seems that this series has come to an end. Great job Elsa Day on yet another satisfying and gripping tale,TRUE
