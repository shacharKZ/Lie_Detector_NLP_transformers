" The death penalty is a cruelty that needs to be abolished. Supposedly lethal injection is painless, but often the victims of this horrendous practice convulse in pain before their demise. Sometimes even a second injection must be made to actually achieve the desired result. This is a remnant of medieval torture that is somehow allowed to remain in the civilized world despite it's awful cruelty and needs to end.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is the ultimate eye-for-an-eye punishment and should be used more often. The death penalty sentence is not used unless criminals are guilty of heinous crimes, often involving multiple murders. Eliminating one person that killed multiple victims is the only justifiable punishment. These people are criminals and they do not deserve to continue to live in our prisons, costing tax payers money. Providing these criminals with a dignified, humane, and pain free death is more than they ever showed to their victims.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is definitely one punishment that should be carried out in several situations.  First of all, you get rid of a dangerous criminal without needing to spend the money to educate him/her.  It also sets an example which can help control the lower class people.  It shows that if you commit a terrible crime, you will die for it.  As a deterrent AND a punishment, the death penalty is, by far, an all-in-one type deal.
",FALSE
" Any chance the accused, no matter how small, is innocent means they should not be executed. Juries can be wrong. Life imprisonment is no picnic either, and that would be plenty of punishment, IMO. Maybe doing the execution promotes violence, saying the state can kill, and in some cases killing is OK. Is the reason to execute just vengeance? May not be enough, if you think about it.  Actually cheaper to do life imprisonment, instead of the never ending appeals. And the studies show the DP does not deter others from crimes.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is taking punishment far to extreme. Just because someone makes a mistake doesn't mean they should be killed for that fact. You are not there when the incident happened so you should not be able to decide the fate of another man. The death penalty is painful and taking it to the furthest point just so the government and prove a point.
",FALSE
" Taking a life is never the answer to any problem. Life without the possibility of getting out is deterrent enough. We as a society do not have to sink to the same level as the very criminals that we are sentencing. The fact that they are behind bars is more then enough to give us the peace that we need to sleep at night.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a severe but necessary punishment for the worst criminals in our society. It is the ultimate price, and those who would transgress against our laws must know that justice and retribution will come for the crimes they have committed. It is far cheaper to the taxpayer, and safer for society at large, to kill people that are that evil and dangerous. Imposing a death sentence also serves to give a measure of peace to the families of victims. Some people are monsters and just should not be on this earth.
",FALSE
" I oppose the death penalty because I feel that we as a society must rise above our animalistic tendencies for revenge.  We must show that we are better than those who we hold in judgment for their crimes.  The death penalty is an extreme act with no real value to society.  Many criminals who have perpetrated crimes upon society have been shown to be from very unfortunate circumstances.  These people were often abused as children, frequently have a below average IQ, and studies have shown that brain chemistry can be a factor in criminal behavior which may render the criminal with a very limited capacity to make choices other than the ones they have made in life.  It can also be argued that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment because we do not have thorough enough research to understand all the physiological aspects of the suffering a person undergoes through the various means by which the death penalty is carried out.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be used as the court sees fit. I believe if a person does something that should get the death penalty then so be it. I feel killing someone, child rape, kidnapping, and any other horrid thing, then you should face the death penalty.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is not a good thing to have in any state, people can be falsely accused on a crime that they didn't do. It wouldn't solve any problems with crimes in their states having the death penalty and they will still continue to commit the crimes and it wouldn't even bother them. It's not a good option to have and it should be stopped.
",FALSE
" Life is sacred. Who are we to end a life? People, even criminals, deserve to live. They deserve a second chance. When we end their lives, we end the possibility of them turning their lives around--even if that is within a prison setting.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is wrong every way you look at it. Who is to say that a person deserves to die based on a crime they commited. Do people think they are God now? Do they think the fate of someone''s life and death is in their hands?
",FALSE
" I think we should get rid of the death penalty. It is expensive and life in prison without the chance for parole is a lot better punishment than executing what may be an innocent man or woman. The death penalty is archaic and out dated. Plus most judges have struck it down as cruel and unusual punishment. Death Row should be a thing of the past.
",FALSE
" I love penalty death. The people who make severe mistake should be treated in the proper way. Death is a final procedure. It worth to do so.
",FALSE
" Anyone who commits murder deserves no less for themselves.  They need to know that they cannot get away with taking another’s life.  What better way than to know that what awaits you if you commit murder is that you will have your own life taken from you?  Some may argue that the in today’s system, rarely does anyone on death row actually ever be put to death.  True.  So get rid of all of the bureaucracy!  If a jury finds someone guilty, put them to death without delay.  I’m not arguing that there shouldn’t be mandatory appeals, but fast-track them.  There are those that argue that some innocent people have been put on death row, but evidence and witness memories don’t get better with age.  There is no reason a victim’s family should have to suffer more than the person who committed the crime.
",FALSE
" The Death Penalty is just another form of murder. People who support the death sentence are just as bad as the guilty who are sentenced to die. The bible says to forgive and people need to practice what they preach. It is not for us to decide who dies or lives no matter what they do to others.
",FALSE
" The value of human life is too precious to throw away so callously.  There is no difference between the crime committed by the accused and the government system that carries out the death penalty.  Murder is still murder even if it is in the name of justice. Prison does enough to isolate the criminals from society, and allows the everyday citizen to feel safe without resorting to governmental and systematic slaughter.
",FALSE
" I believe that the death penalty is a horrid thing! Killing people is never right no matter what they did! Honestly would you want someone to kill you because you made a mistake? What about your family?
",FALSE
" I believe that everyone should receive mercy and that should be released from the death penalty. That killing the murders is wrong and killing them is the easy way out for them. We should let them all live out their days in prison. We as a human race are better than to kill people.
",FALSE
" It is not right to kill. The death penalty cost the states a great deal of money more than life. A person should have to live with their past. Death is to easy. It would be better if the person payed back their debt to society.
",FALSE
" The death penalty in America is a more efficient method of dealing with unreformable violent offenders. Prisons cost taxpayers $32 billion dollars every year and it is estimated that it costs $1.5 million dollars per inmate to keep them alive in prison for life. This price will rise and only to keep violent and dangerous people in the world. And this only serves to tell offenders they will be cared for in a safe environment for the rest of their lives.
",TRUE
" The death penalty, or capital punishment, is a barbaric and uncertain method to deal with criminals. There are too many cases that have been reopened and reexamined where new evidence exonerated people that have been on death row for years or decades. Because forensics and other investigation methods cannot be 100 percent sure of a result, there is no way to determine 100 percent that a person is guilty so applying a 100 percent punishment is overboard. We also cannot guarantee that the methods used for capital punishment are humane and pain free. There are many reports of death penalty sentences being carried out where the subject is suffering for long periods of time before expiring. The death penalty also violates the basic right that nobody should be subject to cruel and unusual punishment.
",TRUE
" I disagree with the death penalty because of its cost on taxpayers and the fact that there is no way to undo a wrongful death.  The appeal processes for people on death row is incredibly expensive, more expensive than that of a life sentence, and since there are so many prisoners right now, we end up paying a ton more for death row appeals.  Also, once an inmate is killed, there is absolutely no way that that act can ever be reversed.  Once the (wo)man's dead, there's no return.  I find it disgusting that we still kill inmates in our supposed ""land of the free"" country.
",TRUE
" Death penalty is the ultimate punishment. In my opinion, it should only be used for very serious crimes, and where the evidence is absolutely beyond a doubt. Eyewitness evidence, if only one person might not be enough. I am not completely against the death penalty, for those that do terrible crimes over and over again, show no remorse, etc., I think the death penalty is appropriate. It provides some small closure for family members of the victim.  One thing I come back to is the number of prisoners exonerated from DNA evidence. If they were executed, obviously no way back. Another thing against the DP is the cost, surprisingly more expensive to execute someone.
",TRUE
" The death penalty can do a few things. First and foremost it is used as an example. It shows that you cannot just live behind bars with your food paid for, there is something worse that can happen. In the Philippines i believe you are not allowed to even spit on the street. Thus they don't have to worry about crime because they see what happens when you make a mistake. Inmates cost the state and country an incredible amount of money. If you are someone that takes the lives of numerous people, then it would not be unreasonable for that favor to be returned.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a just deterrent for some of the worst crimes. There is not rehabilitating some criminals and for those the only answer is to put them out of their misery. There is no excuse to continue filling up prisons we can't afford to pay for. It is only fair to many of the families of the victims. It is time we clear out some of the burdens put on the states by allowing those that need it to be put to death.
",TRUE
" I am opposed to the use of capital punishment for several reasons. The first is that it is applied unequally. In cases where the death penalty could be sought, prosecutors sought that penalty only a very small percentage of the time. When it was sought, statistics show the African American men made up more than half of those cases, while they represent far less than half of eligible cases. That is discriminatory usage, and therefore wrong. The second reason I am against it is because sometimes mistakes will be made and it will be used on an innocent person.  Finally, I do not believe it serves as a deterrent to murderers. Lifetime incarceration is the appropriate punishment for severe crimes.
",TRUE
" I believe the death penalty is an appropriate punishment in our society.  It serves as both a punitive measure against the criminal and as a deterrent for others who may consider the same actions.  As a society that values life, we must have something in place that helps to keep order in society and serves as a measure to reduce the potential for capital crimes; capital murder, other felonies with extenuating circumstances, etc.  When someone has committed a heinous crime that takes away the sense of security in society and does grievous harm to a community and family, there is an innate need for justice.  We are a Christian nation and a nation that largely upholds certain biblical tenents, such as an eye for an eye.  While this may seem harsh to some, time and time again the death penalty has been shown to give a measure of comfort to families of victims.
",TRUE
" I do not believe in the death penalty at all for any reason. I was raised in a christian home with a father who a pastor. We are to forgive a person for what they have done and let God be the judge of the person who did the crime. As of now I still do not believe in the death penalty.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is a good way to get people to stop doing the awful crimes that has been going on for decades. The states that have the death penalty seem to have less crimes than the states that don't have it. I believe its a good way to make people thing twice before committing a serious crime. I believe that it should be apart of our judicial system.
",TRUE
" Sometimes, there are those who commit crimes so heinous that there is only one appropriate punishment. That punishment is death. Some would point to wrongful convictions and say that we should abolish the death penalty. I would say that we need to be judicious in our use of it. However, there is room for its use.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is perfectly fine. The penalty fits the crimes commit by those due to be executed. What's fair is what's fair. The rule is, if you have no regard for another's life, we have no regard's for yours.
",TRUE
" I am for the death penalty for the simple reason I believe it is the ultimate penalty for taking someone's life. Cruel and unusual punishment you say? Well think about the cruel and unusual murder that the murderer had on his victim. As speak about victim, I love how the state of California has a death penalty where the murderers on Death Row on average are there for 30 years. The idea is that these condemned men may not have done it and they should have the right to appeal, appeal and when in doubt appeal. Through political activism and with the help of liberal judges the death penalty in California is a sham. The people have spoken years ago and the Death Penalty should be the ""Law of the Land."" I think we should do what the people want.
",TRUE
" I don t agree with death penalty. Death no doubt is a final penalty to a person to his crime. But is that the most severe one? Definitely no. We should use other penalty to either let them pay their guilty. But also make value to the society
",TRUE
" The death penalty is and always has been meant to be a deterrent to crime.  If you kill someone, you are meant to think that if you’re caught, you will die.  That is not the case.   I’m not sure it ever has been.  For whatever reason, people who commit murder are either very calculating and know they will get away with it, or they do it in the heat of whatever anger or drug rage brought it about.  In neither case would someone stop to think rationally, if I do this, I might die.  Even if they did, by the time they’ve lived through all of the mandatory appeals, it is hardly worth anyone’s money time, or effort.  The victim’s family might disagree, but if the death penalty weren’t an option in the first place, they wouldn’t suffer any more.  They would simply have to live with someone living their life in prison- (if that is what the other option is, but that is a different debate.)
",TRUE
" In some cases the Death Penalty is not just an option but required due to the severity of the crime. Some crimes are so bad that death is the only option. Especially when the punishment rarely lasts as long as what the jury decides at the end of the case. Crimes against children and pregnant women are two examples.
",TRUE
" I believe the death penalty should be used more often.  The men and women demented enough to commit horrible crimes do not deserve the luxury of living their lives with 3 meals and a place to sleep at the considerable expense of the taxpayer. The only concern I have with the death penalty is the sentencing of the wrongly convicted, or the people who are actually innocent but have been placed in a terrible position due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Therefore, I think that the penalty should be used every time there is overwhelming evidence that the accused committed the crime, such as there being video evidence with a clear image of the accused's face.  In it's current state, the death penalty exists with a large expense to the state, since appeals keep court costs high.  If overwhelming evidence is presented, that cost can be avoided.
",TRUE
" I think that for certain crimes we should have the death penalty, for crimes such as murder or torture. Why should these people get to live their lives while the others, the ones who they killed or came close to don't get to? Why should their family have to deal with that pain?
",TRUE
" I'd like to believe the people are good and all should be given mercy, that we the people are better than to take an eye for an eye. But sometimes those who do not respect life and have/are willing to take it should not have it. Life it the greasiest thing in the world and taking it from somebody is wrong but taking it away from the bad people may in a small way be justice even thought it doesn't bring our loved ones back. Sometimes to keep the peace mercy can not be given eve if we want believe it is the right thing to do.
",TRUE
" If you kill another you deserve to die. The state should not have to pay for murders to live. The death penalty should be mandatory for murders. The period on death row should be shortened. The death penalty removes dangerous and violent criminals from society and jails. No one should be allowed to life for life in jail after taking life.
