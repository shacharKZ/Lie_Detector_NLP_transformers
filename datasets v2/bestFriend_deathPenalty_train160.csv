",TRUE
" We've been friends since preschool, so far all intents and purposes, we've known each other for our whole lives.  We have similar interests and hobbies, we get along with each other, and we have each other's back.

We have a similar sense of humor and are both academically smart, but huge slackers so we'd stay up late working on the same project. We took similar classes even when we didn't go to the same classes/school so we had that to talk about too. She helps me out sometimes by driving me to the train station or airport, and I repay her in booze.

I can tell her everything and she always gives me the best advice, even if that means she has to tell me the painful truth. I know that I can call her in the middle of the night if I need help and without a doubt she will be there for me and she will help me out. For example, couple of weeks ago I was organizing a very important event for me and she was always happy to help me with organizing, cooking and photographing. We are like sisters and even when we are not able to see each other, we are always in touch via Facebook or phone.
",TRUE
" Me an my best friend have known each other for a while. We are on the same wavelength when it comes to comedy. We have had a relationship where we can give each other a hard time and not take it personal. Just the other day I was making fun of him for having too much grease on his forehead and he took it like a champ. That sounds like a pretty good relationship.
",TRUE
" I've known my best friend since kindegarden. WE've grown up in the same neighborhood and went to the same high school. We stayed in touch though college, though drifted a bit. Once I was back, we picked right up and we've been close ever since. I've known him for almost 30 years!

",TRUE
" My friendship with my best friend is quite good, I think.  Like most people who spend a lot of time together, we do have some occasional problems, but I think part of what makes our relationship great is that we're able to get over most sorts of issues and appreciate one another in the end.  We also have a lot of common interests and are happy to defer to the other person in order to make them happy, if necessary (though that's hardly necessary).  I think ultimately, we just get along really well and enjoy doing whatever together, even if it's not the most fun thing in the world.  For instance, I remember once it was late at night and we were both really tired and out of our minds, and we just had a really good conversation that lasted ages.  Neither of us had anything in particular to say or do, but we were able to just talk and enjoy the company of one another without any awkwardness or pretense.
",TRUE
" My best friend is my cousin. We have been friends since we were young and graduated high school together. We spent a lot of time hanging out throughout all those years. I feel that I can talk to him about anything and we can just hang out and do nothing and still have a good time.
",TRUE
" She has been there for me when I was depressed and wanted to give up on myself. A very supportive person. Very funny, we have the same sense of humor. We can get really stupid when we're together and other people think we're weird. She's also a very hard working person and encourages me to always do my best.
",TRUE
" My best friend and I are awesome together. We always seem to be on the same wavelength and have a ton of inside jokes with each other. We play the same games and have mostly the same interests. There is no judgment between us and we never argue so seriously we cant get drunk and resolve it in an hour.
",TRUE
" My best friend and I are always confiding in each other - not to the point where everything we think about is relayed, but the important stuff we know we want each other to know and not tell everyone else. We always drink together, travel together, and overall have a lot of fun together. We're almost never doing social things without each other. We get frustrated with each other a lot, but in the end it's never that big of a deal.
",TRUE
" The reason that I consider this individual my best friend is because of multiple reasons. First is trust, We have been friends for almost 20 years and not once have him or I gave a reason to not trust or not show loyalty. I trust him more than most of my family members and being a liar or not show loyalty is the worst traits to have. Also, we share common interests such as movies, music, food and and having fun.
",TRUE
" My friend is very loyal.  She is understanding and comforting.  She's there when I need her.  She will do things for me that other friends won't.
",TRUE
" We have been friends for over 20 years.  We met in college and were in the same fraternity.  We both have a lot the same interests.  We live really close to one another and see each other a lot. He often helps me when I am in trouble.
",TRUE
" My best friend and I share so many similar interests we can stick together through all the hard times.  Like today I showed her a picture of a dog that won a contest for the world's ugliest dog and we both thought it was cute.  It's a small thing, and insignificant to most I'm sure but it's the little things that keep us together despite it all.
",TRUE
" My best friend I have known for 25 years. We used to work together and lived by each other and had a child the same age. Even though we moved away, we still get together at least once a season to catch up and laugh. We traveled the world together 9 times! No matter when we talk on the phone, we always catch up!
",TRUE
" Our love for each other is relatively unconditional. We have realized over time we both make mistakes regarding everyone including each other, and in order for our relationship to grow we will need to forgive and forget. We also help each other whenever possible, financially and emotionally. Friend had trouble paying speeding ticket that would suspend her license if not paid in a timely manner. I did not hesitate in loaning her cash to get her through the tough time.
",TRUE
" Felix is probably my best friend, now. We are good friends because we are interested in many of the same things: from anti-capitalism to music. He will often  share half his food with me even if he spent lots of money on it. We live together as roommates and haven't had any major problems. We also are apart of the same organization and usually work together, well.
",TRUE
" We have alot in common. We have alot of the same friends and we share alot. Ive known her for a very long time and she is someone i can trust completely. When i need a shoulder to cry on she is there as i am there for her when she needs it.
",TRUE
" My best friend is always there for me.  No matter when I call or need him, he is there on the drop of a hat and is super dependable.  When I was in college and having trouble with a class he was willing to come over and help despite just working back to back 12 hour shifts at work before my test.  When my first child was born, and my wife was laboring in the hospital for 10 hours, he was there the whole time in the waiting room for support and to get us anything we needed.  My best friend is truly one of a kind!
",TRUE
" My friend Case has been my best friend since 3rd grade.  He understands me for who I am and accepts me regardless of my mistakes.  He is an amazing best friend.  I truly appreciate his friendship and support.  He's awesome!

",TRUE
" I have know this individual for about two years, we met at a work training seminar.  Turns out that this individual went to the same college as I and has family in the town where i grew up.  We have the same interests, friends, jobs, and are able to tell each other what is really going on in our minds at all time.  I think of this person more as a brother than a friend.
",TRUE
" I'm friends with a girl I met in high school. We met because we sat in a group of five or six students at the back of the school bus for three years. We eventually became seat buddies and got to know each other. Our lives took different directions but we keep in touch by phone. We are very comfortable with each other.
",TRUE
" There are some people in our society who do not belong in it.  They made that choice, but they don't think they should have to live with it...or die by it.  Wrong, my friend: You decided to unleash your hatred of the good people of our society by doing your heinous crime and now you must pay the price by giving up your right to live.  I'm not saying we have to dance in the streets when a criminal is executed, but we have to be loud and clear that they are responsible for their actions and must accept the consequences.  Without just rules governing societal behavior, we will descend into anarchy, chaos, and the collapse of civilization.  I didn't yip and yap with pleasure when Bin Laden was killed, but I certainly did not mourn his passing.  I feel the same about murderers and rapists..there is no room in society for these foul criminals.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is painless all the time. The death penalty does no harm and is quick. The death penalty does not cost much to administer. The death penalty is always a 50/50 chance at life.
",FALSE
" All life is sacred.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Even if someone did something horrible, they shouldn't have to die.  They're still a human being and deserve to be treated like one.
",FALSE
" I believe that taking a life, no matter how awful the crimes are is wrong. Each person is placed on this planted for a reason and to take that person off the planet is wrong. No matter what, a person deserves to live a life even if it is behind bars. Sometimes people are accused of crimes that they did not commit and if they are put to death then that would be considered murder.
",FALSE
" Society needs the death penalty. It deters future criminals and is the only way for families to obtain retribution and move on. There is no disproportionate discrimination in society; the people who get the most death sentences just happen to be minorities. We cannot do without the death penalty because it teaches people that they cannot just get away with capital crimes.
",FALSE
" The death penalty doesn't teach a criminal a lesson, because if they are killed they are no longer alive to learn from it. It also does not seem to be very convincing to other criminals, our murder rates are at a high even with the death penalty in place. If thou shall not kill, we are being hypocritical by telling the murderer he is wrong but we are also going to murder him or her. If it does not dissuade, then it serves no purpose. Being sentenced to prison for life is actually worse punishment, as that person will have to live with what they have done every day, and also suffer attacks from other prisoners, especially child molesters and killers.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a travesty and affront to the civilized world. Almost every other developed country has banned this despicable practice. Murder sanctioned by the state is never right and that is what the death penalty is. Not only does it sometimes result in the killing of an innocent man it wastes tax payer dollars in endless appeals.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is important because it acts as a deterrent. Criminals need to know that if the commit a severe enough crime, there's a chance the state will have them killed. The states that don't allow the death penalty are all bleeding-heart liberal states. Texas has the right idea.
",FALSE
" It is morally wrong to kill. We are putting people in jail for crimes like murder and then using the legal system to turn around and murder them as well. We cannot impress upon people that a certain crime is wrong if we then use that same crime to punish them for - the same crime. It does not teach people a lesson.
",FALSE
" I am totally for the death penalty ! If you kill someone or brutally rape someone, you should fry for it ! ""An eye for an eye"" should be our motto in capital cases. Maybe then, people will think twice before they kill somebody.
",FALSE
" The death penalty saves tax payers money.  Why should I pay for criminal's expenses instead of letting them die.  After all, most murders deserve death since they kill others.  We should execute more prisoners.
",FALSE
" Our families are not safe.  People are murdered on the streets; Homes are being invaded; Gangs are controlling entire neighbourhoods.  Our judicial system needs the death penalty as a strong deterrent to this out of control violence.  The death penalty has been used in every part of the world for thousands of years and has not been found to be immoral or unjust.  We need to keep the death penalty and use it more often to protect our families and our country.
",FALSE
" How would you feel if your loved one was brutally murdered? Most people would want to get closure, and the only way to do that would be to take ""an eye for an eye"". The man or woman who kills must realize the consequences of such a heinous action. If people truly know that they will get the death penalty, they will be deterred from killing in the first place and crime will decrease.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is not a deterrent at all.  What it really is is a burden on taxpayers who pay for death row convicts to live out their lives in prison.  In addition, there have been so many convicts later proven innocent with updated technology such as DNA.  Man is not God; man makes mistakes, and having just one person wrongly killed under the death penalty is one too many.
",FALSE
" What if the alleged offender seeked justice on a wrong doer, avenging. There have been self defense cases where one defended himself and received this harsh penalty. Why are those who judge the offenders get a watch someone die slow that never harmed them? Sometimes, this penalty is praised.
",FALSE
" The death penalty prevents death. It discourages criminals from committing the ultimate crime, because that they too might die because of their deed. Having a death penalty marks off this one crime as the one that cannot be made up for, and cannot (in theory) end in a short sentence and a slack probation. Where a death penalty is in force, killers know they will not be freed to kill again.
",FALSE
" We are a country of laws and regulations that are for the saftey of the majority. Some crimes are so bad that we must remove those offenders from our society completely because it is not worth the risk of keeping them. Some people there is no hope of rehabilitating and it is unfair to ask us to continue to pay to keep them in the system when there is no hope of them turning there life around. The death penalty is about keeping our children and society safe and not burdening the tax payer, it is also setting an example to discourage criminals from committing those crimes.
",FALSE
" Every action has consequences. Sometimes these consequences are good, and sometimes they are bad. These consequences are distributed in proportion to the action. Capital punishment is one of these consequences. It is reserved for the most heinous of crimes, always involving murder. By being a citizens of this country, you agree to follow the law. Everyone knows that when breaking the law, you will get punished. In this sense, capital punishment is not immoral; it is the pre-determined punishment for especially egregious crimes. If a murderer wants to keep his life, he should have considered this basic principle before committing the crime. There is no reason the worst criminals in this country should be exempt from the appropriate punishment.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is an inhumane way to deal with prisoners.  Although the crimes committed by these individuals range in severity such as serial raping, murder, and other atrocious crimes, the people who committed these are crimes are human.  These people should be given a life in prison, where they can be controlled and separated from society so they no longer are a threat, while we do not stoop to their level and take their lives from them.  By killing them, we are becoming what they are.  The death penalty has been used in the past, and innocent men have lost their lives due to this.
",FALSE
" Sometimes a crime is committed that is so odious to the moral sense that only supreme justice is called for. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter capital crimes. It can purge society's lingering guilt in the fact that justice is complete and final. Victims' families can get some well-deserved closure and society can move on from the crime without having to wait for a life sentence to be served.
",FALSE
" The notion that innocent people are wrongfully killed because of the death penalty is vastly overblown. Criminal trials take too much time, money, and effort for a completely innocent person to be convicted time and time again. Just because someone says that they are innocent, doesn't make it so. A jury found them guilty for good cause, and people are often hesitant to hand out the death penalty. It's clear that there are times when a crime deserves a punishment like death, and any other punishment would be too easy. Having them rot in prison is just a drain of tax money. The death penalty deserves to stay.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is necessary because it deters some of the most serious crimes. If people fear the death penalty, they will be less likely to commit terrible crimes.  If our only punishment is to lock them away in a jail, it is not enough of a deterrent.  If someone takes the life of someone else, their life should be taken from them.

" I don't think the death penalty should be allowed.  The death penalty is inhumane and no one has the right to take someones life.  Not even the government.

There is no need to kill them in order to protect society.

" The absence of a death penalty would encourage potential pursuers of capital crimes to go forwards with their intentions. Even if they're caught, the law won't permit them to be physically harmed. In fact, there is even a chance they could settle down with a nice life in prison with friends, spouse, etc. Only the threat of death will be enough to dissuade sane but evil criminals from enacting their murderous plans.

" I feel like the death penalty is absolutist 100% needed. I feel like there is no hope for anyone. If they are bad they will always be bad and the death penalty is for them. I feel like we should be using it more often because it will rid the world of those who cannot be saved!

" the death penalty should be abolished. killing someone non matter who they are is inhumane. there is no reason for someone to die no matter what kind of crime they committed. the drugs for the death penalty are expensive and in humane. killing someone in response to what they did is not equal. two wrongs do not make a right. the taxes paid for people on death row would be used for something else just as bad like bailing out companies that can't keep the finances together

" I believe the death penalty should never be an option for criminal punishment. It goes against my religious beliefs to condemn anyone to death, and I think supporting the death penalty is making oneself accessory to murder. The proper punishment for violent criminals should be rehabilitation, and if this fails imprisonment should be the last option to maintain public safety. The death penalty is never appropriate. The death penalty serves no purpose and destroys human compassion.

" The death penalty is a great idea. If a person has committed such a hateful crime to another individual then they should pay the ultimate sacrifice by giving up there own life in return. Anyone who has a loved one that as life has been wiped out by another person deserves justice. This justice should be by removing the life from the person that caused such pain and suffering. It is my belief that a person who has received the death penalty has done something so immoral that the possibilities of that person ever being productive in society is very low. They would be of no use to society and the chances are they have to values or morals and any thing short of the death penalty would make them a danger to society.

" I never have believed in this part of the system. Why should someone that has it in their blood to kill someone else, have to face the death penalty. I wouldn't care of about that person, never liked them. They thought they were too good, so I'm going after them, where they will not see daylight again. They won't act like they are too good for me. I say, set them free, and continue with the next.

" To believe that repaying a murder with a murder is archaic. The death penalty in it's most simple nature is murder. The death penalty creates an environment where people can believe that in certain cases it is right to take a life and that you can make that decision. A better approach would be to rehabilitate a murder and return them as a productive member to society. This would teach that we all have a redeeming quality and would develop an environment that encourages people to find the good in one another and work through issues that they may have.

" The death penalty should be left intact.  Why should the citizens pay their hard earn taxes for criminals to live? That money could be better spent elsewhere such as schools or hospitals.

" The death penalty can be categorized as cruel and unusual punishment, banned by laws in modern society. So why should the option even exist. There are too many innocent men and women convicted of crimes in our broken justice system that may even be facing the death penalty themselves. How is that fair? I do not think we are at the necessary level we need to be as a society to be accepting of the death penalty. It has been around since man invented the justice system.

" The death penalty is a necessary practice. It provides justice and a sense of closure for grieving families of victims. It is only reserved for the vilest criminals. There is no purpose in keeping such evil people alive- it is simply a drain on taxpayer dollars to continually feed someone that has demonstrated any lack of morality or self-control. There is a growing problem with prison overcrowding as it is. There is simply no reason to keep certain criminals alive.

I don't think that the death penalty is justified because lots of prosecutional techniques aren't 100% accurate. Lots of innocent people have been put to their deaths, only to have the evidence be reexamined and the verdict overturned. If a system can't accurately and undisputably implicate an individual then capital punishment should not be enforced.

" ""Judge not lest ye be judged.""  These are still important words that should resonate throughout courts.  The death penalty might be a contact sport in Texas, but most other states, and most other countries have turned their backs on this form of 'an eye for an eye.'  It does not reduce the amount of crime, and even people who receive the death penalty will spend the rest of their lives on death row, never to have to experience the penalty.  That makes it meaningless, it gives rise to silly lawsuits from prisoners on death row who have far too much time on their hands, and states spend fortunes on these 'special' prisoners.

" I believe the death penalty is good in certain cases such as serial killers, and bombers. I believe the death penalty provides a piece of mind for victims and families of victims.

",TRUE
" My real opinion is that sometimes someone does things that are so horrible and heinous that the only way to bring about justice is to end their life.  Their death won't change the situation, but it will send a message that such things are not tolerated.

" The death penalty is acceptable and useful in theory but distorted by society's current and past applications. It is correct morally, from a consequentialist perspective, that a murderer should have his life taken in return for another's. But statistics show that minorities and men are heavily discriminated against by receiving a disproportionate amount of death sentences. The death penalty should not be practiced currently and should only be reinstated when better and more objective evidentiary and judicial measures can be practiced.
",TRUE
" I agree with the death penalty if there is 100% proof that the defendant did the crime. I also think we are too easy with the way we put these killers to death, I believe they should be punished just as they did with their victims. The only problem I have is that there have been cases where an innocent person has been put to death and that is why I believe there needs to be definitive proof, such as admission, video tape, reliable witnesses or DNA that can not be refuted. If it seems that a person who is being executed suffered at all, the family or anyone should not be able to sue the state or anyone else by a matter of law.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is needed in our current criminal system. We spend thousands of dollars housing criminals which could go to the education of children and reduction of crime. Ultimately some people are not redeemable and should be killed for their crimes. It is clear that the death penalty should be reinstated as those criminals who have committed egregious crimes on our society should not burden it further.

" I don't support the death penalty because I don't believe the state should be given the power to kill citizens. It sets a dangerous principle. Not only that, but I also don't trust the state not to murder innocent people, as has happened in the past.

" THe death penalty should absolutely stay. Some criminals, dangerous murderers, cannot ever be redeemed and why should the rest of us in the working world work to pay for them to be kept and given food and shelter?

Someone like that must be a bit of a tortured soul anyway and its almost a kindnes to them to put them to sleep.

" All my life I have been for the death penalty for capital cases. The older I get, the less I feel that way. Many people have been executed unjustly. Modern advances in DNA testing have proven people innocent years after the fact. The death penalty has absolute finality. Let's try to abolish it.

" The death penalty is counter productive to justice.  It's a way out for severe criminals.  Our prison system is ruthless and bleak.  People who commit severe crimes deserve to suffer in these conditions.  We should not liberate them through death.

" What are the costs of keeping the death penalty?  One of the costs is the potential of putting innocent people to death that were wrongly convicted.  Juries make mistakes all the time and innocent people have been put to death in the past.  Is one innocent life put to death important enough to stop using the entire system?  In this case, I believe so.

" The death penalty is an outdated, ineffective, and expensive means of punishment that should be completely banned in the United States. Almost every other developed country in the western world has banned the death penalty, so why is the US still living in the past? The death penalty is archaic and it promotes a vicious cycle of responding to violence with violence. Even with the death penalty, violence in the US is sky high. Also, if killing is so bad, then it should be bad even when it comes to killing others who have committed horrible crimes. I have heard it costs more to carry out a death penalty than to give someone life in prison so it is ineffective in that way as well.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is a deterrent.  It comes from the old eye for an eye philosophy and it keeps justice balanced.  If just one person doesn't commit murder because they don't want to die themselves, the policy is worth it.  We have to keep society safe; this penalty helps to do so.
",TRUE
" The death penalty legally serves as a way for justice to be served. There are plenty of crimes people commit that involves the loss of others lives we can't get back. The penalty also stands as a threat to show criminals that you can also be murdered for murdering. Enforcement of this penalty should live in the minds of wrongful people.

" The death penalty makes us all murderers. If it is wrong for a criminal to kill, surely it is wrong for twelve respectable citizens to vote to kill, and for a variety of guards and wardens to participate in the killing. To be consistent, we must all be against killing, especially cold blooded heartless killing done with a sense of righteousness and justice. that is why I will argue against killing, and always pity those killed. all life is sacred, not just life that knows itself to be ""good.""

" If we are saying that we are punishing people for committing horrible crimes by putting them to death then we can't justify that by doing the exact same thing. We are not Gods and we do not have the right to say if someone lives or dies, this makes us murders just the same as the person we are punishing. It is not up to us to say someone's life is without meaning or purpose. It is not up to us to say someone's life is over and they have no more time on this earth. We cannot continue to preach that hurting and killing people is against the law unless we do it, that it hypocrisy at its finest.

" We must question everything the government does, and capital punishment is no exception. Perhaps one of the most important, yet less obvious questions we must ask about a government action, the death penalty included, is how does it benefit society? Will it contribute more to this country than the alternatives? And the answer is no. Study after study has shown that capital punishment is (1) more expensive than life in prison with parole, (2) it is not a deterrent, and (3) that the courts have made countless errors in death penalty cases. Considering that it is more costly and is not a deterrent (and therefore serves virtually no function than to carry out retribution, another word for revenge--one of the most primitive and low emotions), it does not contribute more to society than the alternatives. And considering that hundreds of people have been sentenced to death, only to be later exonerated by DNA evidence, the use of capital punishment is not acceptable, as there is no room for error when talking about a person's life.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is fair and just punishment for severe crimes against humanity.  The death penalty helps convicted criminals by allowing them to skip the punishment of life in prison, which is not really a life at all, while relieving society of the burden of keeping them alive.  The death penalty is actually more humane than actually keeping the person alive, and the death is as painless as possible.  I believe that all states should adopt and use the death penalty.
",TRUE
" The Death Penalty is odious for a variety of reasons. First, it makes the state the arbiter of death, a position from which its power can be abused. Second it amplifies the biases already present in the justice system, falling on minority prisoners more often than not. Third, it's eradication would be a cost reducer in the justice system. These are the three main reasons sensible people should oppose the death penalty.

" The death penalty is complicated. In a perfect world, I would support the death penalty. I believe that there are some crimes that are so heinous that the criminal cannot be re-introduced into society. As such, he or she is a burden to society and should just be killed. However, because our justice system is not perfect, I disagree with the death penalty. Too many innocents can be put to death. The costs outweigh the benefits.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is wrong because it is never right to take another person's life.  We can never truly be certain of someone's guilt or innocence.  Too many times we have declared someone who had been put to death actually innocent.  I feel this makes us murderers ourselves and no better than the criminals.  Also, the ways we put people to death are painful and inhumane.
",TRUE
" I believe the death penalty should be allowed.  Capital punishment is a necessity for criminal deterrence.  If someone is mental sick enough to take someone else's life then they are the ultimate threat to society and therefore deserve the ultimate punishment.  If we don't set an example, then other criminals will not be deterred.
",TRUE
" My basic belief is that it is always wrong to take another life.  So the death penalty would go against everything I believe in.  However, if someone killed someone close to me, I am not sure how I would feel about the death penalty.  Life in prison without parole may be a harsher punishment than death.
",TRUE
" While death may be the just end for the truly horrendous criminals, the realities of our justice system make it an unreasonable and untenable punishment. First of all, the cost associated with the lawyers, judges, juries, and other people required to push a sentence of death forward takes a toll on society. Additionally, the justice system does not work perfectly, and death cannot be undone for those who are incorrectly jailed and sentenced. It would be best to abolish the death penalty and instead direct money towards better law enforcement.
",TRUE
" I think the problem is not with the death penalty, but it is with the legal system who sometimes ignores facts and innocent people are killed.  However, I am for the death penalty. In fact I'm for an even greater measure. If some one breaks into someone's home and brutally rapes, tortures, and then kills someone or a group of people - I believe that person should feel pain when they die.  They caused so much hurt and anguish I think they deserve a little bit of that.

" I feel like there is a time and place for the death penalty. I feel as if there is times where it may be needed. And times when it isnt.

So I honestly believe it is needed but is also not needed in some cases.

" every state should have the death penalty. i believe that the death penalty should be ore severe depending on what the crime was. i firmly believe that if you murder someone you should get the same penalty that you gave them. if you shot and killed someone you should be sht and killed as well. i disagree with people who think the death penalty should be humane. it was not humane when the person committed the crime so why should the criminal be treated the same. i believe people who get life in prison should get the death penalty. paying for people to spend life in jail is a waste of state and federal tax money. that money chouls be used to people who need it and making school better.

" I believe the death penalty is a necessary evil in modern society. As I am not hindered by religious motivations about the sanctity of life, I have no reason to believe that the death penalty is morally wrong. I think that in cases of extreme violence or madness, death is the proper punishment when a person is a danger to the lives of other human beings. I believe the death penalty should be given to those who murder, and also support the death penalty in cases such as those of an extremely violent rapist or sexual predator. The death penalty serves its purpose when a criminal is truly beyond help or rehabilitation.

" I personally believe that the death penalty is immoral. It is not right for another human being to take another persons life. This is GODs place to judge not peoples. Even if a person that committed a crime took the life of another, that does not mean that it would in any way be OK for someone to take their life. There is a judgment after death and someone who has taken a life will have to answer for it at that time.

" I stand for the death penalty. I believe someone that does harm to someone else, deserves to be punished. There are people in this world that are so cruel and undeserving that they just want to take someone else's life for their gain. The death penalty is harsh, but I believe that if someone's intentions are to do intentional bodily injury to someone else, they deserve to get the same punishment on themselves.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is vital for us to be able to teach that murder is wrong. Without it there is no real consequence from the murder of someone. In some cases the murderer can be released back into society which develops a mindset that you can get away with killing someone. This also gives the family and loved ones of the victim the sense that they can not trust in the judicial system. This sometimes results in people taking the law into their own hands resulting in more deaths and more lives being affected.

" I think the death penalty should be abolished or seriously looked into. What if the evidence that incriminated the defendant is invalid?

" I believe the death penalty is absolutely necessary in some criminal cases, such as murder. When taking someone elses life with intent, it is only fair that the price you pay is your own. That victim will never get their life back, so why should the perpetrator still have theirs? It is simply based on fairness and an ""eye for an eye"" belief. I also believe it to be beneficial to society in that most people would think twice about murder considering the fact they know if they are caught, they will pay with their own life.

" I don't think there should be a death penalty.  Death is final; if other evidence is discovered 5 or so years down the road that proves the defendant was innocent, it is too late.

" My belief is that the death penalty should be enforced. This is because people ought to be afraid of the consequences of their wrongdoings. Lots of individuals do not fear simply going to jail and observe such punishments as merely ""a slap on the wrist"".
