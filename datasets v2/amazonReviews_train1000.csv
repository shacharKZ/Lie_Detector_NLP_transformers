"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

It was great to watch two people fall in love with each other but try to play it off as something casual,  I loved how we really saw Pipers book come to life and the two of them live it.

This is the second book of Robins I have read I loved the first but this one I think I loved even more.

Besides that, I did like the story. I'm a big fan of paranormal romance, and this one was different enough from the usual to be fresh and interesting. After a slow start detailing the travels of the heroine, things really picked up when she finally found what she'd been looking for all along - a vampire. The characters were likable enough, though some plot lines seemed a little forced. Paranormal secondary characters were enjoyable, but I found the heroine's best friend to be pushy and kind of obnoxious.

I'm not sure if I'll grab the next one, knowing I'm setting myself up for another cliffhanger (did I mention I really don't like cliffhangers?). It will depend on if the story sticks with me in the next couple of weeks.",TRUE
"Having thought the Left Behind series was a little overdone and drug out too long with very archtypical characters, I was a bit hesitant to read Babylon Rising.  However, I found myself quite surprised at how enjoyable the book was to read.  The characterization seemed more real, and the plot did not get bogged down at all.

This book, and hopefully a series of books, will provide good adventure with a mix of Bible teaching.  No, they aren't going to be deep works of fiction, but still very enjoyable to read.  To me, it was like Indiana Jones, but with a Christian twist!",TRUE

"we adopted a basset who was completely out of control on leash and out for walks.  Lunging uncontrollably at people and dogs she went by for attention, we couldn't even get a block away without her going crazy.

I ordered this collar and now 2 days later I took her to my daughter's bus stop and she sat at my side didn't lunge or try to drag me towards the kids so she could jump all over them.  I've only done maybe 3 small corrections and then she gets praise for being a good girl.

our hopes are to get her to act this well on a standard buckle collar in time but this is definetely a life saver for her!  And she is happy to wear it never seems to be in pain and we've had it properly fitted by our trainer before using it.

"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade.",TRUE

"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have.",TRUE

I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.,TRUE

It appears they were printed in layers of blues, reds and yellows to make each ocean animal image, but the printing didn't overlap perfectly to make a crisp picture. You can see a bit of each primary color around the edges of each animal, thus making the finer details (like eyes and little fins) fuzzy. There were also thin black lines streaking thru the images.
Also, these 13 images are printed on two large plastic sheets (like a plastic table cloth), so you need to cut them apart with scissors. I thought I was getting a ready-to-use product, and it added unanticipated time.",TRUE

"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:
- Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James.",TRUE

"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product. I do wish they were less expensive; but we need them, so we buy them.",TRUE
"This rug is awesome. It is so comfortable and the quality is great. It was delivered on a stormy day and survived transport. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

I hate sloppy pliers. I feel that this plier has a low level of slop in the joints. Which is impressive considering that it has twice as many joints as a conventional plier.

"My cat needed lysine - but she didn't like it in any form (capsule mixed into her food, gel, chew).  This one was the best - she will eat it sometimes, if I break it into 2-3 pieces, unlike the vet's chews, which cost a good deal more and were completely rejected.  This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much).",TRUE
"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen.",TRUE

"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",TRUE

"I've enjoyed this series, and believe we may have to face a TWO state solution ourselves in the VERY near future.  As pointed out throughout the 5 books, freedom loving people cannot coexist with nanny state leftist progressives.

This leaves us with one solution to our political problem: A Free State America and a Progressive Union America.  We as a people can then ""vote with our feet"" as to which side best represents our hopes and dreams.

"I bought this for my wife. She hates learning new electronics and is quite picky about things like this. She loves it! First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately. So far my wife and I have been very impressed with it and she does not miss her favorite watch it replaced.",TRUE

"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops.

"When I'm seriously tired, this coffee machine infuriates me. Because if I""m tired I forget how particular it is about how you line up the basket. Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is.",TRUE
"Mounted this on the back of my 32 foot camper. Used their 50 foot extension cable and mounted the transmitter on the front of the camper. It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable.",TRUE
"This is the third book in the series.

Daryl is a polar bear shifter in the Tennessee Honey band. He is older then the reat and has felt alone for sometime. While taking a dip, he meets Matt who happens to see him in his polar bear form. Matt's dad is a grizzly shifter and not the best person (even though Matt has been sheltered from this information). When Daryl meets Matt's mom Alison, there is a connection between them two of them. Alison doesn't want to act on it due to her ex and believes Mat should come first. Matt is getting to the age of shifting, so Alison ask Daryl to talk with Matt. During this time, everyone becomes closer including Daryl and Alison.

Can Alison over come her fears of losing Matt? Is Daryl willing to take a chance and stay with them?

You might want to cry and hot someone while reading this book. I really enjoyed the depth that this book took in Daryl's story.

"Not sure what to say about this lantern that hasn't already been said. It floats, it has multiple lighting options, it hangs, you can take off the cover for direct lighting, it has a red mode and it just plain works. I've used it in the rain, in the water, in temperatures below 0F and in tropical locales. This sure gives my gas lamps a run for the money. I just can't say enough good things about this tough lantern. Its survived a 5 foot drop on the ground, being covered in snow and even a fall in the water. Not to mention all the sand and dirt and crap that goes with that. And it still works.

The twists and turns of this book will keep you on the edge of your chair.  It would make a great movie to help expose the problem of human trafficing that takes place around the world.

"The book starts off with the main character at a young age with a foreshadowing event. Then we skip forward in time to a teenage Emmy sneaking in the house. There are some funny moments in the story, it does take awhile to build the story and some parts seen slow.

There was an undercurrent of a love story but enjoyed the twist. I will honestly say my review and eating is also based off the fact that there is supposed to be a second book.

Anyway, the stick works really well but doesn't last long as I had to constantly apply it even during the middle of ripping.

"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",TRUE

But my 3-year-old grand-daughter had other things in mind than watching historical, or history-making, movies.  This Care Bear proved the right companion to get her to bed and end her pestering us for more presents.  In short, this aristocratic but convivial Barney might be just as appropriate for a bear-deprived, discerning and appreciative adult as a child.  It would probably even make a bear-lover out of Stephen Colbert.

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",TRUE
"Excellent book! Being a parent is never an easy job, it comes with great responsibility on how we are going to deal with it. This book gives you insights and advises on how to face the challenges of being a parent and on how you are going to deal with your kid's personalities and characters in the right manner for them to become responsible of their own actions. Communication is a lot needed to understand each other, too, it is a give and take relationship. We should learn to listen and connect with them and even become a child if needed, that way we will be able to understand them. Be fun and creative! I highly recommend this book!",TRUE
"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft.",TRUE

"There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows thats what everyone else does.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the flashing rings, the seller or with amazon, except for as a customer.",TRUE

"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

"Needed some long cables to hook up charging stations for my wife and my Kindles at our bed.

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.",TRUE

"I received this pack today, 2 days after ordering it.  Sold and shipped from Amazon, and I paid  $75.79 for the silt gray in small/medium.  I was planning on writing this review after using this pack.  But I'm so impressed by its design that I want to shout it out!  :)  I plan to use the Raptor 10 for long road bike rides in the Colorado Rockies.  I usually stuff my bike jersey pockets with snacks, chap stick, cell phone, small wallet, warm gloves, warm synthetic hat, reading glasses in eye glass case (so I can see what I'm doing to change flats!), inhaler, and I tie a long sleeve bike jacket around my waist!  Wow!!  I'm looking forward to using the Raptor 10 on my next ride!  I'll update my review soon.

Update:  July 24, 2012
So far, I've used this pack on two long road bike rides, where I spent a good amount of time climbing out of the saddle.  It is still a 5 star item to me.  Love the design of the water system!  The pack felt comfortable against my back w/o any noticeable water sloshing.  Everything came out of my back jersey pockets and into my Osprey.  Sweet!!!!  More back comfort!  On my first bike ride, I found the straps were so easy to use that I made ALL of my strap adjustments while riding!!  What a well designed pack.  It's too small for day hikes though, but perfect size for bike rides!!!  Planning to get another Osprey pack that's big enough for my day hikes.",TRUE

"This was a really interesting film. I think what the writer was attempting here was a look into our ""shadow"" selves. It definitely was trying to show that we are many different people, and we show different ""faces"" depending on who we are dealing with throughout our lives. I found the music to be somewhat annoying. I didn't might the drums so much but the creepy sexual undertones in an Ingmar Bergman style along with the 40's esc dramatic - and I might add ""irritating"" music. The switching to creepy black, and white; as well as the image of spiders also reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's style of cinematography. The scenes in which the characters didn't ""turn the damn lights on"" kind of bugged me. Again, the Director may have intentionally done this to show that sometimes we ourselves are not even aware of these different layers within our personality's. Be sure to watch the interview at the very end of this film if you're left feeling like...""What the Wha--...did I just watch?""",TRUE

He was able to assemble the story, the facts, the characters and the energy in a way that leaves the reader begging for more.

Each chapter dramatically reveals new information, only to end with new questions arising.  As a result, I found it impossible to find a good spot to stop reading.  Five hours later, I finished the book, completely sated and thrilled that this book found its way into my hands.",TRUE

"I have noticed a big difference in my arthritic cat since switching over to Nutramax. Before she would always lay in the other room, in a cat bed and she'd never really get up and do anything. After a few weeks of taking these pills she was not only up and about, but she was playing, jumping up into her cat tree, and cuddling with me on the couch. It was like night and day. I've had no problem with her or my other cat eating the food that the supplement is on. What I do is I put their food on a small dish, not bowl, squirt fish oil onto the food and then sprinkle the supplement as evenly as possible over their food. At first I was giving them the food in a bowl but would find a lot of the supplement laying on the bottom of the dish not eaten.

"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from.

"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.

Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.

"A LED light in the $5 to $7 range that works as well as this one has to be worth some kind of gold star. I replaced an 6 volt Xenon Lantern with one of these only it works better - much.

These things are flashlights or devices that I - a retired electronics engineer don't see how they can build at this price point much less how good and solid they really are and how well they actually work.
Under no circumstances would I mount one on a Picatinny Rail Mount (even if it fit), or other life/death applications but - me I just need a flashlight.

"Having an elderly cat (18) and two younger cats, we were running into issues where the regular food was to hard for my old fellow to chew, and in a very short period of time, he lost a lot of muscle, dropping from 17 pounds to only 10. I tried some specialty ""older cat"" food that stopped the weight loss, but of course both of the younger guys (a 22 pound Ragdoll and a 16 pound tabby mix) thought that the food the elder got was best, and protested their food, too. And, of course, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to feed to three large cats, two of which are super active.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared. We still use a wet food supplement for the older cat (which, of course, the young guys love, too) to maintain his weight and health until he passes, but we are in the region now where we won't have to auction off one of our teenagers just so we can feed the cats!",TRUE

"Got this as our older router/wireless AP was having difficulty with having XP and Win7 machines connected at the same time.

Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue.

"As many other people have reported, the vinyl is nice and heavy and very white. 9' x 20' is a great size for my studio.
I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll.

"Dr. Schmidt has given us something with substance to read in order to be proud of being a Christian. His background makes him a expert in observing society and understanding its trends and dirctions.
In a world of cultural confusion and everything goes, he makes you sit back and realize that if the modern pagans succeed in erasing Christian influence from society, all that will follow will be the muck and mire our ancestors fought so hard to escape from.
Society today in its ""Post Christian"" age is already showing signs of marked decline. how sad they have not realized that the good old days were not prechristian.",TRUE
"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders.",TRUE
"**Copy received in return for an honest review**
This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner.",TRUE
"This is a beautiful costume. Nicely constructed with quality materials & a zip-up back. The costume does not look like many of the other cheap princess dresses out there. You will love it! People thought I had made the dress because of the quality look. It fit true to size. Only down side, the elastic at the arms is too tight. I removed the elastic & the sewing still keeps the sleeve shape but this change made it wearable for my daughter. I took  1-star off for the sleeve issue. But overall its a 5-star dress.",TRUE

"I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.

I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed. I was able to put it together by myself in about 45 minutes.

It's bigger than I expected it to be, but it will be worth it for happy birds.",TRUE
"Warning- some spoilers inside:
Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better.
Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry.
And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing.
The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.
I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three.",TRUE

I spent quite a bit of money on the pheromone diffusers before trying the collar, and I do feel this collar works much better.",TRUE

"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

7/10 would recommend.",TRUE

"It another one of those movies where twins are played by the same actor.
This tired old trick was cute years ago with the Parent Trap.
But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try.
This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher.
Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twins
as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.
This very old visual trick never works.
You can tell when people do not make real eye contact with
each other.
This film might have even been interesting if they had used
two different actors who look kind of alike.
But overall it's not funny or full of action like Pinapple Express.

"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned.",TRUE
"This is a GRAPE WOOD piece and only suitable for dry (desert) habitat tanks.

"Alpha werewolf Yeager stumbles upon his mate during a biker get together in a small town.  Theres just one problem: his mates just a child.  So he resigns himself to waiting for her to grow up.  Years later, he returns to claim her, only to find that his arch-enemy has also discovered his mate and wants to destroy any chance Yeager has for everlasting love.

The idea of a werewolf finding his mate when shes too young is a new one for me, and I enjoyed the twist.  It also added a dimension to Yeagernot just that hes a good man, willing to wait, but also that when he shows up years later, hes been yearning and lonely for her all that time.

The addition of the rival wolf and the extremes he goes to to keep Yeager and Cassie apart gave the book a lot of tension.  AndI won't reveal any spoilersbut the ending is a whole nother twist that I didn't expect.

Fabulous series of books. Finished them all as quickly as I could. This story grabs & holds on for dear life. Only suggestion would have been to condense the series from 8 books to 5.

"As a young child I saw this movie in the theater and I have never forgotten it.  It has seldom been shown but I never forgot how wonderful an experience of life and adventure it was.  The cast was perfect and kept largely to the novel.  Lana Turner, Donna Reed, Edmund Gwen were perfect in their roles.  For its time this movie was far ahead with the special effects and photography.  I recommend this film to those who still believe of the courage of youth and the joy of reconciliation as older people.  I just can't recommend this film enough.",TRUE

"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time.",TRUE

But this is a problem with the bottle it was in not the cleaning aspect of it. I don't understand why some reviews are going against the product, for it is a cheap kit, so you get what you pay for, don't complain you didn't get the world's greatest product for just $10. It does the job it supposed to, are there other better cleaning kits, yes, but for just $10 this is great for casual use especially if you are an amateur photographer.",TRUE

I know that taller women often have issues finding leggings of a decent length but these would be great if you are taller! The color is not a dark black but more of a smoky black. Super comfy and the pockets are an added plus so they look more like pants but have the elastic waistband of leggings.

"I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.",TRUE

"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.",TRUE

"This book was so inspiring as well as riveting.  Jenna has a wonderful talent for being totally honest about her life while at the same time conveying the lessons she's learned with wisdom and maturity.  She also talks a lot about relationships and just how hard they can be and when you really love someone just how much you have to put up with, and sometimes (when it comes to relationships) just when you should walk away.

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

This is definitely the kind of book you could read over again and still gain new insight, not to mention all the beautiful photographs.",TRUE
"What a beautiful story set in a small town with delightful characters. This story covers many emotions and realities in life from living with the loss of one's spouse, dealing with adult children, managing finances, working on committees, and even finding love again. What happens when a mother becomes a recluse and shuts her children out because she doesn't want them to know she has health issues? When a child is given trust of a mother's finances and abuses it? Can two mature adults find love? ""How do you know when to trust and when to keep things to yourself?"" I loved the story of Helen and Mike and their families that intertwine to create this Christmas Journey.",TRUE

Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs.",TRUE

"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",TRUE
"I ordered a size 10 and the top straps on the pair I received were too small for my medium-width foot.

Too bad, because other Croc flip flops I have ordered are great.  These not so much.",TRUE

I'll be checking out American Princess again.",TRUE
This book is an icon. It melds together the new with the old. I read the book and keyed in on the vast minutia and trivia of the 70s and 80s... my son read it and keyed in on a lot of the modern day tech speak. GREAT BOOK.,TRUE

"Shortly after starting to use this product I developed my first ever case of Pink Eye. The doctor verified that it was not a viral or bacterial infection. I couldn't figure out what it was and the pink eye continued off and on for 6 weeks (the first 2 weeks was pretty severe). I finally put 2 and 2 together and came back to Amazon to read all the 1 Star reviews for this product and could not believe what I was reading. How can a product this dangerous be sold as an anti-fog solution that you put next to your eyes? I threw the product away and my eyes have fortunately cleared up. However, I spent a couple of hundred dollars on new contact lenses and eye doctor appointments.",TRUE
"The construction of this Mag-Lite Solitaire is really quite good.  It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.",TRUE

"Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection. If you're a fan of the show, character, or just love collecting figures, get this, it's a solid purchase!",TRUE
Great cover. Thick canvas material that covers seat well. Bought this to protect the leather middle seats in my 2014 Honda van.

I recently met Dr. Lienhard at a book signing in which he graciously answered questions from an audience and took time to converse with buyers while autographing their purchases. Dr. Lienhard has the knack of bringing the scholar's intellect to the study of culture and technology without the slightest condescension.

"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath.",TRUE

(The ones with ""chew guard technology"" last after he's ripped a hole, pulled out the squeaker & stuffing, etc, if anyone's interested LOL)  This ball was his new favorite as soon as he saw me take it out of the box.  It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

"Like most folks, I'd like to spend as little money as possible to complete my projects. Skimping here was not a great idea, however. If you're not aware of what a proper connector should look like, or if durability is not a concern, then this certainly looks like a great deal. It's half the price of a quality part. And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build.",TRUE
"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",TRUE

* Something would blow up.
* Stephanie would not be driving the same car at the beginning and end of the book.

Well, I was right. This book is chick-lit-lite -- it took one evening to read and while enjoyable there was nothing that knocked my socks off.

In fact, I would recommend either of those options if you have not already purchased the book.

It opens up a whole new side to shifters and elves. This a great start to a new series in V. M. Black's aetheral world. I think it's a wonderful expansion the The Alpha's Captive.",TRUE

"This was the first toy that I introduced to my baby. She was just starting to reach out and explore things with her hands. I would sit her in her Bumbo with a tray or in her swing with a tray and stick the Wonder Wheel on in front of her. She would bat at it and even accidental ""hits"" would case it to spin which amused her greatly. She loves this thing!",TRUE
I have a relatively small arm so these were no way near as tight as the picture portrayed...more for a muscular arm I'd say,TRUE
"I was looking for something to protect my Kindle DX in transit. I decided I would rather just take the Kindle out to read than get the kind of case designed to hold the Kindle while you read. I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

In sum, a fine product that does exactly what I want.",TRUE
"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

I've brought it in the shower and into a swimming pool with me and had no problems, so it seems great for water sports and activities.",TRUE
"The PDF manual has some great examples.  I am linking 3 buildings and using VLAN, Storm protection and STP.  I've only had for a couple days.  My primary reason for this switch is to help isolate SIP phones at a small business. Seems to work great so far.  Gives me just the right level of control of my network.  I will update my review after I have used for a few months.  But others complained the unit was loud ?  Not mine.  Maybe they are using different fans now?  I cannot even tell it is turned on.  So happy that way....",TRUE
"This is the only earbud that fits my particular aural cavities, and the sleek controls have become a welcome addition to my daily travel. I dread the day when my last pair breaks !",TRUE

"Would be a 5 but unlike headlights that use batteries which gradually grow dimmer, when this needs to be charged, it literally shuts down.  So if you're out in the woods on a dark night, you have nothing.  Could be scary and even dangerous.  One note that can be either positive or negative is that the beam is pretty focused, more of a spot than a flood, so you can see far in advance.  I like it, so a positive for me.  Living in AK, I never go anywhere in the winter without a headlight.  Most of the time I only use the low beam, which is plenty to find my way around.  Also love the red light, which is a great one for going outside, has enough light to see where you are going, and still be able to see the stars or the Northern Lights without your eyes having to readjust.",TRUE
Quality product that is an easy install and works as it should; nothing else much to say.,TRUE
"Price was great. Delivery was outstanding. We've purchased the same food from the per store (20% more $$$), so, we knew the dogs liked it.",TRUE
"I just finished this. I have always been fascinated by the Ice Age era. As an avid hunter and outdoors-man, I noticed a few things that didn't seem plausible- not enough to detract from the story. Just started the 2nd of the series, hope it is as good as the first.",TRUE
These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.,TRUE
"Excellent book. Funny, insightful. Puts a modern day angle to the age old questions of good vs. evil. Another great work from two of our best fiction authors.",TRUE

"Ordered this black faux leather chair for my desk-top computer.  It is wonderful to sit in--comfortable, can adjust to my 5'9"" frame.  I sit for hours sometimes & I don't get back pain or other aches.  Easy to adjust, no popping as someone else mentioned.  My husband put it together in a few minutes without difficulty.  Very happy with this chair.",TRUE
My overweight tom cat has lost 2 lbs of body fat and is doing well with this food. I recommend it highly.,TRUE

This is a Beautiful little knife. The fit and finish is great and it is so small you forget your carrying it. Love this blade. It is a shame they discontinued this chairman series.,TRUE
"I've wanted this minifigure for a while, didn't get it because it was a bit expensive.
I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The colors were not as seen in the pictures. It looks more yellowish that orangish. Which makes it look cheap and more like a knock off.
I tried to fit it in the Lego minifigue dispay case, but it was pretty hard to fit since there is a hose coming from his backpack tank, and the front one is long too.
In conclusion I like this guy, but not a big fan of the color the colors. If I could I would paint it.",TRUE
"Cute, I got this for my son (age 8) as a gift for getting good grades. He loved it.",TRUE
"It took me a bit to get into but overall I liked the story. It is fast paced and a quick read. I think that if you want to try reading something from the sci-fi genre, this could be a decent book to start with.  I voluntarily reviewed an ARC of this book.",TRUE
I bought all the variations of Keepons and these are still the best. They definitely hold your glasses on because they make the best skin contact. They are a medium size but can stretch over most glasses.,TRUE
"Easy to configure, and expandable too. Nice that it serves as an extender besides being a power line adapter. Already added a separate 4220 extender to another part of our house. My desktop doesn't have a wireless card, so I moved one 4220 to an outlet by the desktop and plugged in an Ethernet cord (cat5) and I have internet where I have no modem or Ethernet port previously! Love this system for ease and expandability!",TRUE
"Maybe its wicked but Alexa Rileys stories are like a fairy tales, only for adults. Kinky, steamy, and naughty fairy tales. And who does not like a good tales before bedtime?

The blurb really say it all. Alexander bought land with mansion on it, where he wants to build a airstrip for his plane. He is determined workaholic and wants to tear down the house. But when he comes and sees the angel in there, his plans must change dramatically. Liliana was alone in the house after the death of her grandmother. Alexanders arrival sees as a miracle, she was waiting for him that he would come and save her.

Its like a prince on a white horse comes to free the princess. On the one hand, innocent and pure heroine, and on the other posessive and barbaric hero. Its love at first sight, so sweet, completely irrational and even more sinful. We can always count on described in detail steaming scenes, and here even though it is very short, there is not lack of them.

I have so many cool quotes from this one. It has a perfect balance between sweet and charming, and filthy and scorching hot. Alexander and Lilianas story is very quick, sexy and beautiful.",TRUE
Love this set of clippers. I have used it at least 4 times. It's a great set. Well worth the money I paid and it comes with alot of guards for different hair lengths. Would definitely recommend this product!,TRUE
I originally saw most of this play on screen a few years ago on PBS. I was delighted to find that it was released on DVD. Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore are superb in this intimate drama of two elderly people in a nursing home who become acquainted with one another through playing gin together. It was originally a play and it is a play on film. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys a good play on film.,TRUE
First Stone novel. Good read. And it was not even a Parker novel. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Been a long time since I read a novel.,TRUE
"My 3 year old enjoys many things, running, playing ball, he loves cars, he loves play food, play cooking and feeding the dog play food. (The poor dog!) When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it.",TRUE

"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.

I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...

Please see my other review on Amazon of yoga and meditation dvds.",TRUE
Remarkably flat and wooden dialog; must have taken some doing.,TRUE
I could not have been happier.  The pups were not annoyed at all by their collars.  I kept an eye on them so they were neither to loose or too tight.  And MADE IN THE USA!!!!!,TRUE
"Fast delivery! Item was not expected to be here for two more days but it came in today!

It's only my first day wearing it and I like it a lot! I wore it under jeans for a majority of the day and my butt looks AMAZING!!! Now I tried it with leggings and it doesn't look bad but just not as good. You could see the lining of the undergarment. I'm gonna try it with my other leggings, pants and dresses and see how it goes. But I would definitely recommend this item!",TRUE
"REVIEW REFERENCES the ""Wireless"" Unit:

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

Cons:
1. Nothing major, but note that structural walls will degrade your signal slightly; and that's going to happen with pretty much any wifi product you buy.",TRUE
"Great deal.  Kind of light weight material, so they didn't last as long as I had hoped, but was well worth the price.",TRUE
I loved this book from start to finish. Have you ever wanted to hug someone and choke them in the same breathe ? Well I did several times. Zack was the hurt lost soul and it took Kate to bring him out of the darkness. This book will make you cry laugh and then melt as you fall in love with Zack and Kate..,TRUE
"This is a very sturdy dufflebag, holds enough for a weekend getaway. End pockets are quite large.",TRUE
"Inexpensive,and works great. Very securely packed to prevent shipping damage.
The instructions and data were spot on, including voltages at startup and at idle. It has multiple stage charging, going to an idle state when the battery is fully charged.",TRUE
"Have now tried this product on 5 different cats.  Two gobbled them down with tablet inside.  One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all day - IT worked.  One cat sniffed and ran regardless of what I tried.

CATS ... what can you say other than that?

At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!

Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).  Think I may try the salmon flavor on other cat, can't hurt to try, if she doesn't like, the other cats may and at ~$6.00 no big investment.",TRUE
