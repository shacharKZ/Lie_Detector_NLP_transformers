" There are some people in our society who do not belong in it.  They made that choice, but they don't think they should have to live with it...or die by it.  Wrong, my friend: You decided to unleash your hatred of the good people of our society by doing your heinous crime and now you must pay the price by giving up your right to live.  I'm not saying we have to dance in the streets when a criminal is executed, but we have to be loud and clear that they are responsible for their actions and must accept the consequences.  Without just rules governing societal behavior, we will descend into anarchy, chaos, and the collapse of civilization.  I didn't yip and yap with pleasure when Bin Laden was killed, but I certainly did not mourn his passing.  I feel the same about murderers and rapists..there is no room in society for these foul criminals.

" The death penalty is painless all the time. The death penalty does no harm and is quick. The death penalty does not cost much to administer. The death penalty is always a 50/50 chance at life.
",FALSE
" All life is sacred.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Even if someone did something horrible, they shouldn't have to die.  They're still a human being and deserve to be treated like one.
",FALSE
" I believe that taking a life, no matter how awful the crimes are is wrong. Each person is placed on this planted for a reason and to take that person off the planet is wrong. No matter what, a person deserves to live a life even if it is behind bars. Sometimes people are accused of crimes that they did not commit and if they are put to death then that would be considered murder.
",FALSE
" Society needs the death penalty. It deters future criminals and is the only way for families to obtain retribution and move on. There is no disproportionate discrimination in society; the people who get the most death sentences just happen to be minorities. We cannot do without the death penalty because it teaches people that they cannot just get away with capital crimes.
",FALSE
" The death penalty doesn't teach a criminal a lesson, because if they are killed they are no longer alive to learn from it. It also does not seem to be very convincing to other criminals, our murder rates are at a high even with the death penalty in place. If thou shall not kill, we are being hypocritical by telling the murderer he is wrong but we are also going to murder him or her. If it does not dissuade, then it serves no purpose. Being sentenced to prison for life is actually worse punishment, as that person will have to live with what they have done every day, and also suffer attacks from other prisoners, especially child molesters and killers.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a travesty and affront to the civilized world. Almost every other developed country has banned this despicable practice. Murder sanctioned by the state is never right and that is what the death penalty is. Not only does it sometimes result in the killing of an innocent man it wastes tax payer dollars in endless appeals.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is important because it acts as a deterrent. Criminals need to know that if the commit a severe enough crime, there's a chance the state will have them killed. The states that don't allow the death penalty are all bleeding-heart liberal states. Texas has the right idea.
",FALSE
" It is morally wrong to kill. We are putting people in jail for crimes like murder and then using the legal system to turn around and murder them as well. We cannot impress upon people that a certain crime is wrong if we then use that same crime to punish them for - the same crime. It does not teach people a lesson.
",FALSE
" I am totally for the death penalty ! If you kill someone or brutally rape someone, you should fry for it ! ""An eye for an eye"" should be our motto in capital cases. Maybe then, people will think twice before they kill somebody.
",FALSE
" The death penalty saves tax payers money.  Why should I pay for criminal's expenses instead of letting them die.  After all, most murders deserve death since they kill others.  We should execute more prisoners.
",FALSE
" Our families are not safe.  People are murdered on the streets; Homes are being invaded; Gangs are controlling entire neighbourhoods.  Our judicial system needs the death penalty as a strong deterrent to this out of control violence.  The death penalty has been used in every part of the world for thousands of years and has not been found to be immoral or unjust.  We need to keep the death penalty and use it more often to protect our families and our country.
",FALSE
" How would you feel if your loved one was brutally murdered? Most people would want to get closure, and the only way to do that would be to take ""an eye for an eye"". The man or woman who kills must realize the consequences of such a heinous action. If people truly know that they will get the death penalty, they will be deterred from killing in the first place and crime will decrease.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is not a deterrent at all.  What it really is is a burden on taxpayers who pay for death row convicts to live out their lives in prison.  In addition, there have been so many convicts later proven innocent with updated technology such as DNA.  Man is not God; man makes mistakes, and having just one person wrongly killed under the death penalty is one too many.
",FALSE
" What if the alleged offender seeked justice on a wrong doer, avenging. There have been self defense cases where one defended himself and received this harsh penalty. Why are those who judge the offenders get a watch someone die slow that never harmed them? Sometimes, this penalty is praised.
",FALSE
" The death penalty prevents death. It discourages criminals from committing the ultimate crime, because that they too might die because of their deed. Having a death penalty marks off this one crime as the one that cannot be made up for, and cannot (in theory) end in a short sentence and a slack probation. Where a death penalty is in force, killers know they will not be freed to kill again.
",FALSE
" We are a country of laws and regulations that are for the saftey of the majority. Some crimes are so bad that we must remove those offenders from our society completely because it is not worth the risk of keeping them. Some people there is no hope of rehabilitating and it is unfair to ask us to continue to pay to keep them in the system when there is no hope of them turning there life around. The death penalty is about keeping our children and society safe and not burdening the tax payer, it is also setting an example to discourage criminals from committing those crimes.
",FALSE
" Every action has consequences. Sometimes these consequences are good, and sometimes they are bad. These consequences are distributed in proportion to the action. Capital punishment is one of these consequences. It is reserved for the most heinous of crimes, always involving murder. By being a citizens of this country, you agree to follow the law. Everyone knows that when breaking the law, you will get punished. In this sense, capital punishment is not immoral; it is the pre-determined punishment for especially egregious crimes. If a murderer wants to keep his life, he should have considered this basic principle before committing the crime. There is no reason the worst criminals in this country should be exempt from the appropriate punishment.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is an inhumane way to deal with prisoners.  Although the crimes committed by these individuals range in severity such as serial raping, murder, and other atrocious crimes, the people who committed these are crimes are human.  These people should be given a life in prison, where they can be controlled and separated from society so they no longer are a threat, while we do not stoop to their level and take their lives from them.  By killing them, we are becoming what they are.  The death penalty has been used in the past, and innocent men have lost their lives due to this.
",FALSE
" Sometimes a crime is committed that is so odious to the moral sense that only supreme justice is called for. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter capital crimes. It can purge society's lingering guilt in the fact that justice is complete and final. Victims' families can get some well-deserved closure and society can move on from the crime without having to wait for a life sentence to be served.
",FALSE
" The notion that innocent people are wrongfully killed because of the death penalty is vastly overblown. Criminal trials take too much time, money, and effort for a completely innocent person to be convicted time and time again. Just because someone says that they are innocent, doesn't make it so. A jury found them guilty for good cause, and people are often hesitant to hand out the death penalty. It's clear that there are times when a crime deserves a punishment like death, and any other punishment would be too easy. Having them rot in prison is just a drain of tax money. The death penalty deserves to stay.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is necessary because it deters some of the most serious crimes. If people fear the death penalty, they will be less likely to commit terrible crimes.  If our only punishment is to lock them away in a jail, it is not enough of a deterrent.  If someone takes the life of someone else, their life should be taken from them.
",FALSE
" I don't think the death penalty should be allowed.  The death penalty is inhumane and no one has the right to take someones life.  Not even the government.  If someone murders a person then that person should go to jail for a really long time or even for the rest of their lives.  As long as they are kept outside of society we can be safe.  There is no need to kill them in order to protect society.
",FALSE
" If a person killed another person they should always receive the death penalty.  An eye for an eye seems to fit in this case.  The death penalty may deter some people from killing another person.  However, a truly evil person probably wouldn't pay attention to that.
",FALSE
" The absence of a death penalty would encourage potential pursuers of capital crimes to go forwards with their intentions. Even if they're caught, the law won't permit them to be physically harmed. In fact, there is even a chance they could settle down with a nice life in prison with friends, spouse, etc. Only the threat of death will be enough to dissuade sane but evil criminals from enacting their murderous plans.
",FALSE
" I think that it is inhumane to kill anyone - even people who have tortured and murdered others.  They have souls and it is possible for them to change their hearts.  They should be allowed to live comfortably in prison for the rest of their lives to think about what they have done.
",FALSE
" I feel like the death penalty is absolutist 100% needed. I feel like there is no hope for anyone. If they are bad they will always be bad and the death penalty is for them. I feel like we should be using it more often because it will rid the world of those who cannot be saved!
",FALSE
" the death penalty should be abolished. killing someone non matter who they are is inhumane. there is no reason for someone to die no matter what kind of crime they committed. the drugs for the death penalty are expensive and in humane. killing someone in response to what they did is not equal. two wrongs do not make a right. the taxes paid for people on death row would be used for something else just as bad like bailing out companies that can't keep the finances together
",FALSE
" I believe the death penalty should never be an option for criminal punishment. It goes against my religious beliefs to condemn anyone to death, and I think supporting the death penalty is making oneself accessory to murder. The proper punishment for violent criminals should be rehabilitation, and if this fails imprisonment should be the last option to maintain public safety. The death penalty is never appropriate. The death penalty serves no purpose and destroys human compassion.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a great idea. If a person has committed such a hateful crime to another individual then they should pay the ultimate sacrifice by giving up there own life in return. Anyone who has a loved one that as life has been wiped out by another person deserves justice. This justice should be by removing the life from the person that caused such pain and suffering. It is my belief that a person who has received the death penalty has done something so immoral that the possibilities of that person ever being productive in society is very low. They would be of no use to society and the chances are they have to values or morals and any thing short of the death penalty would make them a danger to society.
",FALSE
" I never have believed in this part of the system. Why should someone that has it in their blood to kill someone else, have to face the death penalty. I wouldn't care of about that person, never liked them. They thought they were too good, so I'm going after them, where they will not see daylight again. They won't act like they are too good for me. I say, set them free, and continue with the next.
",FALSE
" To believe that repaying a murder with a murder is archaic. The death penalty in it's most simple nature is murder. The death penalty creates an environment where people can believe that in certain cases it is right to take a life and that you can make that decision. A better approach would be to rehabilitate a murder and return them as a productive member to society. This would teach that we all have a redeeming quality and would develop an environment that encourages people to find the good in one another and work through issues that they may have.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be left intact.  Why should the citizens pay their hard earn taxes for criminals to live? That money could be better spent elsewhere such as schools or hospitals. The money could be better spent on bettering the community instead of housing more criminals that contribute nothing to society.
",FALSE
" The death penalty can be categorized as cruel and unusual punishment, banned by laws in modern society. So why should the option even exist. There are too many innocent men and women convicted of crimes in our broken justice system that may even be facing the death penalty themselves. How is that fair? I do not think we are at the necessary level we need to be as a society to be accepting of the death penalty. It has been around since man invented the justice system. Dont you think we would have evolved since the middle ages?
",FALSE
" death penalty is right. an eye for an eye. if someone killed then why do you want to keep that person alive, i believe thats its right that the person be killed too so he suffers the same fate. if you decide to keep the person alive or in jail for a little period of time for her wrong doing then its tax payers people's money that shall be used to maintain him, i dont think thats right. kill him and be done with that chapter, also let the familyy of the offender know what it is to loose someone.
",FALSE
" A life given for one taken.  A sentence of death should make someone stop and think before killing another person.  Criminals convicted of the death penalty should be executed within a short period of time.  Death sentences instead of life in prison would save the penal system money.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a necessary practice. It provides justice and a sense of closure for grieving families of victims. It is only reserved for the vilest criminals. There is no purpose in keeping such evil people alive- it is simply a drain on taxpayer dollars to continually feed someone that has demonstrated any lack of morality or self-control. There is a growing problem with prison overcrowding as it is. There is simply no reason to keep certain criminals alive.
",FALSE
" I believe that regardless of what horrendous acts an individual performs, he or she is deserving of life. I don't think that the death penalty is justified because lots of prosecutional techniques aren't 100% accurate. Lots of innocent people have been put to their deaths, only to have the evidence be reexamined and the verdict overturned. If a system can't accurately and undisputably implicate an individual then capital punishment should not be enforced.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a cruel act. You're either electrocuted so that your insides are cooked. Or given a series of injections that paralyze you while you drown in your own bodily fluids. Or you're placed against a wall facing a gunman aiming a rifle at you, ready to give said wall a fresh coat of paint.
",FALSE
" The Death Penalty is immoral. It doesn't belong in our society. How can you justify one death for another? We aren't God therefore we shouldn't play him.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be allowed in instances that involve a horrendous crime particularly  those that destroy the lives of the people associated with the crime. There comes a point where a criminals action can be so grave that the court has the right to seek redemption by terminated that persons existence. It needs to be done ever so cautiously and as a last resort, but the criminal forfeited his/her rights when they  committed the atrocities.
",FALSE
" I don't believe the death penalty is necessary. People would be better to face humiliation and die in jail, living out a long life of solitude. They aren't hurting anyone or causing another person trouble if they're in jail being watched over. Killing people just shows how cruel a human being can be, why should we do the same?
",FALSE
" I feel the death penalty should be used more often.  When someone kills another human being, they should be punished just as they punished the deceased.  If we do not take their lives, they have not learned a lesson.  They could also go out and kill someone else, and we must stop that at any cost.
",FALSE
" Choosing to take the life of any being is wrong. We have no right to decide the value of life nor to take away the possibility of redemption in any form. There is always the possibility that the person could be wrongly convicted of a crime, and if their life was taken that would constitute a grievous murderous act.  Facilities are adequate to safe guard the person from ever returning to do harm thus negating the need to take a life. If the person is correctly convicted he is not adequately punished by offering death as a way out either. The crime ends with the incarceration and then the punishment of time living with the loss of freedom and the knowledge of what that person has done should be the way that we deal humanely with our criminal population.  The death penalty only brings more death.
",FALSE
" While the death penalty is often protested against for various reasons, these reasons amount to little more than emotional or idealistic pleas. The death penalty is important for our society to retain in an effort to preserve a sense of authority. A government exists because it has a monopoly on violence, and it's authority exists on its right to exercise that right. Give that we have a fair and just court system, we are in a unique position amongst the world's nations to flex that right to power in extreme circumstances. Though using this punishment doesn't lower all types of crimes, it is the case that it mitigates the level and types of crime people are willing to commit, while giving our laws themselves the safe-backing that they need to be legitimate in the eyes of the populace.
",FALSE
" Without the death penalty either or right or wrong you would have even more crime. Without a effective deterrent that even frightens people then you will ultimately just have a society that is about chaos instead of law and order. To keep other people from killing each other sometimes you have to have very severe consequences. You have to make people pause before they ever even dare think about taking another human beings life. Fear is sometimes unfortunately necessary to teach people right or wrong. You take a life you lose your life is the saying that is used and in some cases it is necessary.
",FALSE
" My view on the death penalty is that it is a good thing. The death penalty punishes those that commit severe crimes, by death. The death penalty also gives the victims families the much needed closure that they deserve. The penalty shows other would be criminals the severe consequences of bad actions.
",FALSE
" The people that oppose the death penalty have clearly never looked into the eyes of the victims of these criminals. Without the death penalty how can we tell them that justice has truly been carried out? In our state we should make it absolutely clear that we abhor these crimes. What better way to deter the criminal element than death? They may be able to make friends in prison, even thrive depending on their connections, but you cannot bargain or adjust to death.
",FALSE
" I believe death penalty is necessary to prevent further crimes in the future and punish the killers. I believe our society needs to have this system in place, and that it will work and people will stop killing others a lot less. In the face of evil, the death penalty will always prevail and bring justice to the families of the victims.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is wrong. It deprives a person of their most basic right, the right to life. We should instead try to reform these people. These people would suffer more, having time to consider their crimes while in prison for life.
",FALSE
" killing another man is inhumane, an eye for an eye is an aged belief, we need to create other productive ways to deal with the humans are monstrosity's.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is inhumane and must be outlawed. Supporters of the death penalty believe that it is cheaper than a life sentence. However, this is incorrect. The cost spent to prepare for a lethal injection is moderately more expensive.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is the better options cause it stops criminal from the get go. It saves the state a lot of money plus it shows justice fror the victims.  People who are sentences to death penalty should know that paying with their life's its the least they can do. Plus it makes a pretty good show.
",FALSE
" I do not believe in the death penalty because it is not for us to decide when someone should die. These are human beings and everyone deserves the chance to change. I think this task also takes a toll on those who have perform the killing. I know in one prison, the warden is responsible for administering the lethal injections. I would imagine that would affect him negatively emotionally.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be forbidden. Too many people have been innocently executed due to faulty evidence. Moreover, It ceases any chance for rehabilitation. The person who is sentenced to death does not have the chance to right their wrongs. An eye for and eye makes the whole world blind.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is horrible.  So many people get the death penalty that don't deserve it, it's disgusting.  I can't believe that some places allow you to go in and WATCH as it happens, this is appalling.  Humankind is disgusting.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is always wrong.  There is never room for the death penalty.  To uphold the death penalty is just as bad as murder itself.  Jail is the ultimate punishment because they have to live with their decision.  As long as jail keeps them locked up and alive, they are in hell.
",FALSE
" the death penalty is necessary to achieving less criminals in america. a criminal, for example, is less likely to commit a crime if he knows that he can be sentenced to death as a punishment. death penalty has been proven to be effective in the past. crime rates have lowered because of it's existence in states.
",FALSE
" Capital punishment doesn't deter violent crimes. States with death penality do not show less murder rates. It's inhumane to delibertly kill another person, even within our court system. Some people never get a fair trial especial if they are of color and lack the funds for a decent lawyer.
",FALSE
" People who have committed these horrible acts need to be killed. They do not belong in society or deserve tax payer money and care for them to live out their life. They are unable to be rehabilitated, which is the purpose of the criminal justice system. They don't deserve to live in this world.
",FALSE
" Some people cannot be rehabilitated and definitely should not be released back into the society they have harmed.  Recidivism, or engaging in a repeated offense, is a common theme among many violent criminals.  For those that engage in mortal sins such as murder, there really is no reason to keep them in the prison population where they can take up space and most likely continue in their behaviors.  Also, and the victims of such people deserve to see justice performed.
",FALSE
" I think the death penalty is a great way to punish criminals that have committed crimes that cannot be punished in other ways. These criminals need to be punished in a way that shows them but other would be criminals that the crime that took place was wrong. The death penalty should be used on all criminals that choose to murder, rape or otherwise torture other people.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is an inhumane punishment that no one should have to suffer through, regardless of the crime done. The person who committed the crime has other options for punishment besides death, like life in prison with a severe amount of rehabilitation.
",FALSE
" The death penalty can sometimes kill someone who is innocent. If someone didn't have a fair trial, yet sentenced to death, their death is equivalent to the victim. Death penalty is wrong because it is not man's job to judge who deserves like, but up to God. The death people does not offer first time major offenders a chance to be rehabilitated.If an innocent person is killed from the death penalty, there is still someone on the streets committing the crime.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is awful. Everybody should be given a second chance. Committing murders is usually linked with mental illness, which everybody should be treated for everywhere. If a person really wants to kill, he should be sent to the army or a place where his ""talents"" can be used. This isn't the stone age, where an arm for an arm and a leg for a leg is a death for a death.
",FALSE
" I support the death penalty. Society kills people, even sacrificing its own, in war. Shying away from it would be insulting to me. God? Doesn't exist. It is not a moral question.
",FALSE
" The death penalty should never be used because there is always a chance we may kill someone who is innocent.  Even one life taken from an innocent citizen is too much to allow this process to take place.  It has been shown through DNA evidence that several executions took place on innocent people.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  Please join with me to prevent these horrible crimes against innocent citizens to happen again.
",FALSE
" I think that the death penalty is just wrong.  Prisoners should be put away for life for their crimes.  They should not be executed for their actions.  It is not right to take a life for a life.  Executions are inhumane and a cruel form of punishment and should not be used.  Imagine the agony and fear the prisoner faces when he or she is about to be executed.  Also, the prisoner may experience severe pain during the execution.  Criminals like this should just be put away for life even if it means draining tax payer's money.
",FALSE
" I think the death penalty should be legal because there are people out there who have done horrible things that deserve to die.  if someone murdered or raped one of my family members I might want to kill them  If I can say that then why should that right be stripped from anyone else.  There are just to many bad peopl out thtere and as a society we need to decrease those numbers.
",FALSE
" Wow, That is pretty radical. Doesn't seem coldhearted to say some people are just wastes of space. I don't believe their mother, friends or siblings believe that. I understand where you are coming from but there is no lesson learned in death. It just ends the student. I can't see any excuse where we would give up on human life like that.
",FALSE
" All human life is priceless and valuable. We have basic rights to life, liberty, and justice, despite what we may have done to our fellow human beings. Criminals who have committed heinous crimes absolutely deserve to life their lives in jail. It is a benefit to the taxpayers to never have a false conviction on their consciences and as such, they can support the most reasonable option: a jail sentence.
",FALSE
" I believe that the death penalty is the best solution to resolving a criminal of a hideous crime of murder, or rape and sometimes for repetitive offenders of crimes. I think that noone deserves to live if they kill another person; and the simplest and effective way to solve this problem is to exterminate the problem. I agree that there is no ""teaching an old dog new tricks"" and think it's unfair to the taxpayers to support criminals who are being held for life in prison. I'm one for all to ending it with a humane way of resolving things and the death penalty is the way to go!
",FALSE
" The death penalty should be used more often. It is an effective deterrent to crime. If you are serving a life sentence or perpetrate a heinous crime, you should be responsible with your life. I think more prisoners need to face this charge and be put to death. It will also save taxpayers thousands of dollars and reduce prison overcrowding.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is good because why should our tax money go to feed and house killers and rapists for 20, 30, 40 years? Our prisons are overcrowded anyway, so why keep someone there for life? Furthermore, putting someone to death who has committed these horrible crimes sends a powerful message and will prevent others from also committing these crimes. I also get pleasure from that fact that these criminals will suffer for what they did.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is a very problematic and controversial act in the United States. However I believe that the death penalty should be legal in the United States because tax payers are paying so much money to just provide for these inmates who should just die instead. They are spending tax payers money for their health rather on other essential things such as healthcare. Which is why the death penalty is a good thing and should be acted upon the criminals so that the economy  can become stable again.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is horrible. No one should ever be allowed to give such a penalty. There is no crime that should be punished with death. Even those that are as bad as murderers should not die for their actions.
",FALSE
" I don't believe in the death penalty because religion teaches us that it is morally wrong to execute someone no matter the circumstance. Everyone has the capacity to change and rehabilitate but we won't ever get the chance to see it if there is a death penalty.
",FALSE
" If the death penalty were legalized, people could be sentenced to death for crimes that they did not necessarily commit. It has been shown many times that an innocent person has been sent to prison. In this case, the person can later be proven innocent and released from the facility, but the death penalty is a punishment that cannot be reversed.
",FALSE
" The death penalty is quite effective in preventing crime. If people realize that the crime they commit may cost them their lives, they will think twice before committing the crime. It is also just that people that take a human life should surrender theirs as a punishment. Society needs to be paid for the actions of these criminals, so the death penalty is of benefit to society to exact justice.
",FALSE
" I do not agree with using the death penalty. If a person kills another human being, that person deserves to go to jail for the rest of his or her life. We are not the ones to judge and take justice out on the criminal; that is for God to do. We would have to forgive the criminal for his or her act, but never let him or her out in society again.
",FALSE
" ""Judge not lest ye be judged.""  These are still important words that should resonate throughout courts.  The death penalty might be a contact sport in Texas, but most other states, and most other countries have turned their backs on this form of 'an eye for an eye.'  It does not reduce the amount of crime, and even people who receive the death penalty will spend the rest of their lives on death row, never to have to experience the penalty.  That makes it meaningless, it gives rise to silly lawsuits from prisoners on death row who have far too much time on their hands, and states spend fortunes on these 'special' prisoners.
",TRUE
" I believe the death penalty is good in certain cases such as serial killers, and bombers. I believe the death penalty provides a piece of mind for victims and families of victims. I believe the death penalty scares people into admitting their faults, which is good for confessions for trial. I believe the death penalty makes a way to simple have justice.
",TRUE
" My real opinion is that sometimes someone does things that are so horrible and heinous that the only way to bring about justice is to end their life.  Their death won't change the situation, but it will send a message that such things are not tolerated.  I feel that certain crimes are much more deserving of this (rape, premeditated murder, abuse that leads to the death of a child or animal) than others.
",TRUE
" I believe that there are good reasons for the death penalty.I believe that the death penalty is in place for a good reason and should be used when necessary. Especially if it is a heinous crime/s. The death penalty is put in place for a good reason and it should not be abused.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is acceptable and useful in theory but distorted by society's current and past applications. It is correct morally, from a consequentialist perspective, that a murderer should have his life taken in return for another's. But statistics show that minorities and men are heavily discriminated against by receiving a disproportionate amount of death sentences. The death penalty should not be practiced currently and should only be reinstated when better and more objective evidentiary and judicial measures can be practiced.
",TRUE
" I agree with the death penalty if there is 100% proof that the defendant did the crime. I also think we are too easy with the way we put these killers to death, I believe they should be punished just as they did with their victims. The only problem I have is that there have been cases where an innocent person has been put to death and that is why I believe there needs to be definitive proof, such as admission, video tape, reliable witnesses or DNA that can not be refuted. If it seems that a person who is being executed suffered at all, the family or anyone should not be able to sue the state or anyone else by a matter of law.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is needed in our current criminal system. We spend thousands of dollars housing criminals which could go to the education of children and reduction of crime. Ultimately some people are not redeemable and should be killed for their crimes. It is clear that the death penalty should be reinstated as those criminals who have committed egregious crimes on our society should not burden it further.
",TRUE
" I don't support the death penalty because I don't believe the state should be given the power to kill citizens. It sets a dangerous principle. Not only that, but I also don't trust the state not to murder innocent people, as has happened in the past. To be honest, in principle I do believe there are some crimes that are deserving of death, but I don't support giving the state the right to carry out the death penalty.
",TRUE
" THe death penalty should absolutely stay. Some criminals, dangerous murderers, cannot ever be redeemed and why should the rest of us in the working world work to pay for them to be kept and given food and shelter? Death is not only beneficial for the working world but also for the dangerous criminals. Someone like that must be a bit of a tortured soul anyway and its almost a kindnes to them to put them to sleep.

" All my life I have been for the death penalty for capital cases. The older I get, the less I feel that way. Many people have been executed unjustly. Modern advances in DNA testing have proven people innocent years after the fact. The death penalty has absolute finality. Let's try to abolish it.

" What are the costs of keeping the death penalty?  One of the costs is the potential of putting innocent people to death that were wrongly convicted.  Juries make mistakes all the time and innocent people have been put to death in the past.  Is one innocent life put to death important enough to stop using the entire system?  In this case, I believe so.

" The death penalty is an outdated, ineffective, and expensive means of punishment that should be completely banned in the United States. Almost every other developed country in the western world has banned the death penalty, so why is the US still living in the past? The death penalty is archaic and it promotes a vicious cycle of responding to violence with violence. Even with the death penalty, violence in the US is sky high. Also, if killing is so bad, then it should be bad even when it comes to killing others who have committed horrible crimes. I have heard it costs more to carry out a death penalty than to give someone life in prison so it is ineffective in that way as well.

" The death penalty is a deterrent.  It comes from the old eye for an eye philosophy and it keeps justice balanced.  If just one person doesn't commit murder because they don't want to die themselves, the policy is worth it.  We have to keep society safe; this penalty helps to do so.

" The death penalty legally serves as a way for justice to be served. There are plenty of crimes people commit that involves the loss of others lives we can't get back. The penalty also stands as a threat to show criminals that you can also be murdered for murdering. Enforcement of this penalty should live in the minds of wrongful people.

" The death penalty makes us all murderers. If it is wrong for a criminal to kill, surely it is wrong for twelve respectable citizens to vote to kill, and for a variety of guards and wardens to participate in the killing. To be consistent, we must all be against killing, especially cold blooded heartless killing done with a sense of righteousness and justice. that is why I will argue against killing, and always pity those killed. all life is sacred, not just life that knows itself to be ""good.""

" If we are saying that we are punishing people for committing horrible crimes by putting them to death then we can't justify that by doing the exact same thing. We are not Gods and we do not have the right to say if someone lives or dies, this makes us murders just the same as the person we are punishing. It is not up to us to say someone's life is without meaning or purpose. It is not up to us to say someone's life is over and they have no more time on this earth. We cannot continue to preach that hurting and killing people is against the law unless we do it, that it hypocrisy at its finest.

" We must question everything the government does, and capital punishment is no exception. Perhaps one of the most important, yet less obvious questions we must ask about a government action, the death penalty included, is how does it benefit society? Will it contribute more to this country than the alternatives? And the answer is no. Study after study has shown that capital punishment is (1) more expensive than life in prison with parole, (2) it is not a deterrent, and (3) that the courts have made countless errors in death penalty cases. Considering that it is more costly and is not a deterrent (and therefore serves virtually no function than to carry out retribution, another word for revenge--one of the most primitive and low emotions), it does not contribute more to society than the alternatives. And considering that hundreds of people have been sentenced to death, only to be later exonerated by DNA evidence, the use of capital punishment is not acceptable, as there is no room for error when talking about a person's life.
",TRUE
" I believe that the death penalty is fair and just punishment for severe crimes against humanity.  The death penalty helps convicted criminals by allowing them to skip the punishment of life in prison, which is not really a life at all, while relieving society of the burden of keeping them alive.  The death penalty is actually more humane than actually keeping the person alive, and the death is as painless as possible.  I believe that all states should adopt and use the death penalty.
",TRUE
" The Death Penalty is odious for a variety of reasons. First, it makes the state the arbiter of death, a position from which its power can be abused. Second it amplifies the biases already present in the justice system, falling on minority prisoners more often than not. Third, it's eradication would be a cost reducer in the justice system. These are the three main reasons sensible people should oppose the death penalty.

" The death penalty is complicated. In a perfect world, I would support the death penalty. I believe that there are some crimes that are so heinous that the criminal cannot be re-introduced into society. As such, he or she is a burden to society and should just be killed. However, because our justice system is not perfect, I disagree with the death penalty. Too many innocents can be put to death. The costs outweigh the benefits.
",TRUE
" The death penalty is wrong because it is never right to take another person's life.  We can never truly be certain of someone's guilt or innocence.  Too many times we have declared someone who had been put to death actually innocent.  I feel this makes us murderers ourselves and no better than the criminals.  Also, the ways we put people to death are painful and inhumane.

" I believe the death penalty should be allowed.  Capital punishment is a necessity for criminal deterrence.  If someone is mental sick enough to take someone else's life then they are the ultimate threat to society and therefore deserve the ultimate punishment.

" My basic belief is that it is always wrong to take another life.  So the death penalty would go against everything I believe in.  However, if someone killed someone close to me, I am not sure how I would feel about the death penalty.  Life in prison without parole may be a harsher punishment than death.
",TRUE
" While death may be the just end for the truly horrendous criminals, the realities of our justice system make it an unreasonable and untenable punishment. First of all, the cost associated with the lawyers, judges, juries, and other people required to push a sentence of death forward takes a toll on society. Additionally, the justice system does not work perfectly, and death cannot be undone for those who are incorrectly jailed and sentenced. It would be best to abolish the death penalty and instead direct money towards better law enforcement.

" I think the problem is not with the death penalty, but it is with the legal system who sometimes ignores facts and innocent people are killed.  However, I am for the death penalty. In fact I'm for an even greater measure. If some one breaks into someone's home and brutally rapes, tortures, and then kills someone or a group of people - I believe that person should feel pain when they die.  They caused so much hurt and anguish I think they deserve a little bit of that.

So I honestly believe it is needed but is also not needed in some cases.

" I believe the death penalty is a necessary evil in modern society. As I am not hindered by religious motivations about the sanctity of life, I have no reason to believe that the death penalty is morally wrong. I think that in cases of extreme violence or madness, death is the proper punishment when a person is a danger to the lives of other human beings. I believe the death penalty should be given to those who murder, and also support the death penalty in cases such as those of an extremely violent rapist or sexual predator. The death penalty serves its purpose when a criminal is truly beyond help or rehabilitation.

" I personally believe that the death penalty is immoral. It is not right for another human being to take another persons life. This is GODs place to judge not peoples. Even if a person that committed a crime took the life of another, that does not mean that it would in any way be OK for someone to take their life. There is a judgment after death and someone who has taken a life will have to answer for it at that time.

" I stand for the death penalty. I believe someone that does harm to someone else, deserves to be punished. There are people in this world that are so cruel and undeserving that they just want to take someone else's life for their gain.

" The death penalty is vital for us to be able to teach that murder is wrong. Without it there is no real consequence from the murder of someone. In some cases the murderer can be released back into society which develops a mindset that you can get away with killing someone. This also gives the family and loved ones of the victim the sense that they can not trust in the judicial system. This sometimes results in people taking the law into their own hands resulting in more deaths and more lives being affected.

" I think the death penalty should be abolished or seriously looked into. What if the evidence that incriminated the defendant is invalid?

" I believe the death penalty is absolutely necessary in some criminal cases, such as murder. When taking someone elses life with intent, it is only fair that the price you pay is your own. That victim will never get their life back, so why should the perpetrator still have theirs? It is simply based on fairness and an ""eye for an eye"" belief. I also believe it to be beneficial to society in that most people would think twice about murder considering the fact they know if they are caught, they will pay with their own life.

" I don't think there should be a death penalty.  Death is final; if other evidence is discovered 5 or so years down the road that proves the defendant was innocent, it is too late.

" My belief is that the death penalty should be enforced. This is because people ought to be afraid of the consequences of their wrongdoings. Lots of individuals do not fear simply going to jail and observe such punishments as merely ""a slap on the wrist"".

Put short, people fear death, and only death.

And the final act should be done so as cheaply as possible.

Because in this situation, an eye for an eye can never be completely met when you think about not only if this criminal took the life of another person, you should take into concern all of the emotional suffering you put on everyone involved.

Also, I don't believe we need to spend our taxpayer's dollars keeping people like this alive, especially when they've done enough that they will never live long enough to exit jail successfully.

" I do not like the use of the death penalty.  As human beings, we are not given the authority to judge someone else's behavior to the point of death.  We are not the ones who should be decide when or where someone dies.  Just as the person on death row should not have made that decision for someone else.  If we kill them, that does not make us better, it puts us at their level.

" I have mixed but definable opinions about the death penalty.  I believe that it needs to exist but it is what I would say is a necessary evil.  There are a few circumstances that it is necessary to take human life that usually are based on protecting other human life.  In the case of irrefutable evidence I believe that the death penalty falls under the necessity of ending a life that would be a certain threat to others.  Although the person would not be able to return to society, it would put the burden of the care upon the very society that the criminal would harm to sustain his/her life.  It also continues to put the jailer's lives in harms way. Additionally it may result in saving innocent lives by providing a sufficient deterrent to another criminal doing likewise. In the extreme cases therefore, I believe the death penalty is necessary and just.

" While the death penalty has been used in the United States for some time, there is no indication that is effectively reduces crime. In addition, nearly ever modern industrial nation has done away with this sort of punishment, leaving us as one of the few left practicing it. We need to join the modern world and work focus on solutions that solve problems, not ones that merely look good for show. Combine the fact that the punishment is inhumane and that there is a good chance that innocent people have been put to death under it for crimes they didn't commit, and anyone can clearly see that this punishment is not only ineffective, it has the potential to create additional long term problems regarding our values and ideals.

" I feel the death penalty is a mistake and amoral. The death penalty does not take into account the idea of the greatest human weakness when it comes to that fact that mistakes are made. At different points there will always be mistakes made as this is just the logical conclusion you must arrive at whenever you explore the idea of trying hundreds of thousands of cases and all the variables that are in place. I just think it is silly for people to think they are not going to make mistakes and even get things sometimes outright wrong! So when you are talking about a human beings life you just cannot have this level of error of even on the tiniest level. We are talking about someone's whole life here. Once you take it you cannot come back and say I am sorry we were just wrong on this. It is just too late and you cannot correct that mistake once you put the death penalty in action.

" My view on the death penalty is that it is bad. Despite its means of severely punishing people that have committed severe crimes, the death penalty takes forever to commence. Many criminals on death row barley suffer and live and eat on tax payers money. Criminals should instead be sent to harsh punishment, where their actions will shed light on the dire consequences.
",TRUE
" I believe we should abolish or reform the use of the death penalty. The death penalty as it currently is practiced has been shown to be more expensive than housing a prisoner for life. Current research does not support the idea that it is an especially effective deterrent. The death penalty in my mind represents the failure of citizens to understand that it is not the states responsibility to punish, it is the states job to protect law abiding citizens from criminals and prison is an appropriate vehicle for this. Furthermore I oppose the death penalty due to its unequal application between different races and socioeconomic classes.

" I believe the death penalty should only be reserved for the most heinous and cruel acts of murder, and where more than 2 people were murdered.

",TRUE
" I absolutely support the death penalty. These people have committed horrific crimes and deserve to be punished accordingly.

" I believe in the death penalty because there are those who choose not to be rehabilitated. To me, the death penalty should be reserved for criminals who have shown no sign of remorse or desire to change. Two examples of these types of criminals are, pedophiles and serial killers. Career criminals should also be considered for the death penalty where a heinous murder has been committed.

" I don't see too many things wrong with it. I think certain crimes deserve the most severe of punishments. I do think the victims' families should have a say in whether the person should be forgiven or not though.

I also think that the standard of evidence should be absolutely clear and very high.

Sure one or two innocent people might die here and there, but lets be honest, we're at a population cap as it is.  If I were to go on a killing spree, I'd hope that I wouldn't have to suffer remembering every bit of it, I'd rather be killed.

" The death penalty should only be used for situations involving murder or rape.  The person accused should be innocent until proven guilty.

It's a way the victims of a crime can get revenge for something that happened, but death is basically an end to any suffering the criminal might endure.  Personally, I feel it's barbaric.

" The death penalty is a capital punishment that is very necessary. Some people do such inhumane crimes, they do not deserve to breath the air of the non-guilty.

Keeping such criminals alive with a life sentence is a waste of tax payer's money.  The death penalty ensures that such criminals are eliminated from society.

In the most extreme violations of this code, those that cannot follow it should pay with their lives. It benefits no one but the criminal in question to allow them to live.

Another reason is that people feel that even if they are caught and sentenced, they will be pardoned, and never put to death.
