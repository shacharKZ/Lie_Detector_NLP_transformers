" Abortion gives women an easy way out of their accidental responsibilities so that they become unaccountable for their sexual escapades. Abortion means the killing of life after conception. Abortion affects women emotionally and can leave a lasting psychological affect. The taking of life is not of God's will as he created women to procreate.
",FALSE
" I think a woamn has the right to choose the fate of her unborn child because it is a private issue and it is her body. People make mistakes and if a woman makes the mistake of an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to end that pregnancy. Years ago, woman didn't have that right and abortions were a very risky thing to do by yourself. Many women died trying. Not only that but finding a Doctor to before an abortion was very hush, hush. They were hard to find. Now it can be done in medical clinics specializing in abortions and its done in a very dignified way. Women should be so lucky.
",FALSE
" I don't believe abortion is wrong. The fetus in the womb is not a human being. It is not really a baby or person after conception. It is similar to a fish living in water. It is only a mass of cells that could turn into a human being later on at birth. Since this mass of cells is not human and is not a person, there is no morality involved in the destruction of it. Therefore, a woman has the power to choose what her body does. If she doesn't want to be pregnant, she can abort the fetus. It is her decision to have an unwanted pregnancy terminated.
",FALSE
" Women should have the right to choose what happens with their own bodies and how they live their lives.  Pregnancy and childbirth are opportunities only provided to women and women should be able to control what happens to themselves.  Accidental pregnancies do happen.  As long as abortions are done in the early weeks of pregnancy, prior to full development, women should be able to choose whether or not they carry the baby to term.
",FALSE
" I believe it is ok to have an abortion. That you wouldnâ€™t be judged by people who donâ€™t believe this issue is right. I think that everyone should support a woman that wants an abortion regardless of their personal beliefs. I think Christians ran businesses should not complain about having to provide coverage for abortion in an insurance policy.
",FALSE
" Life begins at the moment of conception. If you choose to have sex, you choose to take on the responsibility of birth control. If you fail to take responsibility for your action and thus get pregnant you create a life that has a right to be given a chance, just like you once were. If you're not prepared to be a parent there's long waiting lists of deserving couples who can't conceive on their own who would make wonderful parents. Be responsible, give life to the life you created.
",FALSE
" I think that abortion is the mother's choice. She is in control of her own body. If she does not want a baby to grow inside of it, no one should be able to force her to do so. An embryo at a very early stage has not developed a personality. Hopefully, they have little or no awareness and will feel little or no pain. So, if the pregnancy is terminated it will be as if the embryo never existed. This is better than bringing a baby into the world that is abnormal, unwanted, or to a mother that is incapable of taking care of it.
",FALSE
" Fetuses have a right to live. If you can't accept the possibility of giving birth, you shouldn't have sex. Pregnancy is a gift, and you shouldn't be ungrateful and try to return it. Your body isn't -just- your own, it belongs to everyone, to god, to the human race. Think of how cute babies are, and everything else will fall into place.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is ok because it is simply a way of preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  A child is not viable outside the womb until the late stages of pregnancy and it can reasonably be argued that if life is not viable outside the womb, it is not a life with value and protection in and of itself.  It is not yet a separate and distinct entity. We have a clear standard in society for what does and does not constitute life.  As long as a woman carries a pregnancy and the fetus in the womb is not viable, it is still ultimately her decision as to whether she wants to carry this pregnancy in her body.  This is a decision that belongs only between a woman and her doctor.
",FALSE
" I beleive the system that supports abortions is necessary. If we don't possess anything else in society we own the right to make our own decisions and choices. A woman should be able to choose whether or not her body will be used to support life. If she chooses not too that is her right.  There are several woman that have been robbed of their choice to conceive in the first place and to not give them a means to decide whether or not they want to live with a constant reminder of how their rights and body were initially violated would be cruel and insensitive.  There are also other women that simply don't have the financial,emotional,or physical means to raise a child. I would rather them to make the choice early than to give birth to a child that does not have a fighting chance. At the end of the day it is the womans body and it should be her choice.
",FALSE
" A baby is a human at the moment of conception. There was a Pennsylvania abortionist who was charged with killing babies that were born alive, but he killed them by severing their spinal cords or slitting their necks. If abortion is legal then a lot of abortions are done as a matter of convenience. If women would take care of protecting themselves and we made that more of a priority unwanted pregnancies would significantly reduce.
",FALSE
" abortion is morally wrong because every conceived life has a right to live, if the mother cant take care of the child there are so many needing families who would lovingly take it.
",FALSE
" Even before it is born, a child is a separate person, entitled to all the rights of other living human beings. Its unique DNA and personhood make it separate from the mother, who has no right to judge whether the child lives or dies. Once a child is conceived, it is the duty of the mother and society to protect it. If the birth parents cannot take care of the child, adoption is the more preferable option.
",FALSE
" Abortion is a good thing. For one, the baby in my opinion is not a human being the first several months. The baby does not have a conscious at this point, therefore we can decide if we want to kill it or not. It is unborn and therefore not a human. It is okay.
",FALSE
" Abortion is perfectly fine in any and all situations. A woman has sole rights to do what she wants with her body. A fetus is just a fetus and not a human being. If a woman is ready to be a mother, then she will choose to give birth. Religious activists often fight against abortion, however God provided physicians with this knowledge to perform abortions, therefor it must be right!
",FALSE
" I am completely pro-life. To kill a baby in the womb is murder. Also it's against Gods will. whoever chooses to have an abortion will burn in hell.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be considered a complete disregard for life.  Life begins at conception and to take a life of a child is a unlawful and full of sin no matter what the age.  People don't know what is best for them in a stressful situation, and when a person is considering abortion, they are not able to think straight about what they are truly doing to an unborn living human being.  A child is a gift to the world and should be treated as such with all the same consideration ever other human being gets.
",FALSE
" Abortion is against God's will.  How will the world ever get better if we allow people to make choice that are against the will of the Creator?  Abortion can ruin a woman's chances to ever bear children again.  It should not be an option at all because there are services available to help women who wish to give up their children for adoption.
",FALSE
" Abortion is murder. A fertilized egg immediately becomes a person whose rights need to be protected. It is unconscionable to allow millions of babies to be murdered for the convenience of a woman who was not responsible enough to use birth control. There are many loving homes to send the unwanted children to.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be outlawed.  This is because it is morally wrong, in any situation.  Regardless of the circumstances, the taking an unborn child's life should never occur.  The unborn infant has the right to life, just like the rest of us.
",FALSE
" And God said, Thou Shalt Not Kill. Abortion is murder and we should not do it because it is morally wrong.
",FALSE
" I believe that abortion is moral in any situation. A mother has the right to decide what happens to her body and if she doesn't want a baby then she has the right no get rid of it. A fetus is not a living person yet so it has no rights. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and a person should not have their life ruined because of one mistake.
",FALSE
" I believe that under no circumstances, should an abortion be allowed, as life is a gift from God and we are given souls at conception. Regardless of circumstance a woman (including rape victims), should give birth to the child as itâ€™s not that childâ€™s fault.  They can always give the child to an adoption agency if they donâ€™t want it. Anybody considering abortion should look at themselves in a mirror and ask what if my parents had done the same.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is evil and murder.  It is clearly taking away a human life, and I imagine that anyone would want to live, if given a choice.  I believe that women are frivolous and cannot be trusted to make appropriate choices, therefore it is up to the lawmakers to ensure that these women make the correct choice.  Abortion should definitely be illegal, with stiff penalties for the woman who had the abortion, the doctor who performed it, and any other accomplices.  Penalties should be fines for the woman, and jail time or loss of license for the doctor.
",FALSE
" This law should be prohibited and all rights to such an action should be vanished. Life should not be something decided. There are very harsh situations such as mother or child in a surgery and a choice needs to be made. However I don't believe that women should just freely get rid of the ""problem.""
",FALSE
" Abortion is a women's right to be able to choose what to do with their body. It is not up to a man or government to tell a woman what they can do with their body. It is moral to have a abortion. A fetus is not living until later in the pregnancy.
",FALSE
" I believe in pro-life. Abortion is the act of killing a fetus. A baby human who is defenseless. If mothers don't want to raise their baby they can give it up for adoption. Abortions causes a lot of stress on a woman's reproductive system and may cause health complications for that woman in the future. Women need to control their bodies by being responsible and using contraception. in the case of rape, the rapist should be punished. Do not punish the defenseless unborn baby.
",FALSE
" I am not against abortion.  I am against the notion of killing human beings, and abortion falls under this spectrum.  If people don't want to have babies then they shouldn't be having sex.  Everyone knows how a baby is made and they should not be allowed to kill a living human being just because they screwed up.  Do we allow people to kill their accountant if he screws your taxes up?  A resounding no, and abortion is no different.
",FALSE
" I believe that all abortion is wrong.  It is murder.  The fetus is a human life and no one has the right to end that life.  Adoption could always be an option.  Abortions are too easily available and are misused as a form or birth control.  Careful sex or family planning is a more viable option.
",FALSE
" Abortion should absolutely not be an option for pregnant mothers.  If a mother is pregnant, she must go through the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption if she does not want to take care of it.  If a woman's legs are open long enough to make a baby, they need to be open long enough to give birth to the baby.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion should be legalized in every state across the world. It is a sin to believe that a person can just choose to let a pure innocent child die. God is watching always at the activities and decisions we humans make and God will surely see the horrible decisions those who choose to carry about abortion make. It is murder. Plain and simple. That child did nothing to deserve an untimely death before it has even had the chance to see the world.
",FALSE
" I am absolutely pro-life.  I think that all babies have the right to live, and it shouldn't matter what the mother's circumstances are.  It is legally and morally wrong to kill an innocent child.  That child was a child the moment it was conceived.  Both birth control and plan b are running our nation and killing our next generation.
",FALSE
" Every life is precious, from the moment of conception. When abortions occur, the mother is basically killing the child. God would not approve of abortion. Abortions cause mental anguish on the mother after the procedure. The actual abortion is a horrific act where the fetus is ripped from the mother's womb. How could anyone do that to their child?
",FALSE
" Abortion can be a good solution to a problem pregnancy.  If a woman has been raped and became pregnant, she would not want to deliver the baby which would always be a constant reminder of the rape.  Also, single mothers sometimes are not capable of taking care of a tiny infant and the better choice would be to abort.  Then if the life of the mother was in jeopardy, the fetus also should be aborted to save the mother's life.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be a human right. Every woman should have the right to choose what happens in and to her body. If she was capable enough top make the decision to have sex and become pregnant, then she should be able to terminate that pregnancy if she chooses. A woman should not be forced to endure something that she does not want and a baby can be a lifelong burden.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be made illegal because it is taking a human life. Our laws restrict against killing another human being and it should be enforced to protect a human being even if it is in the womb. Allowing for woman to proceed with abortion is saying certain human life is valuable instead of that all human life is valuable. Does that human baby not have rights too? Allowing for abortion also allows for women to make poor decisions and then legally take the life of an innocent person who is not her own. She may have the right to make decisions for herself, but not for a second individual that is the infant.
",FALSE
" Abortion is wrong. No matter why a woman believes it should happen, it is wrong. Each women should feel the guilt of having an abortion as it is a sin. This should not even be a problem. Each life is a miracle.
",FALSE
" Abortion is completely wrong! It is murdering a human being, and whoever has an abortion is killing their baby. It doesnt matter if the woman was raped, the child should not be punished. If the mother dies or is physically hindered from the birth of the child, that is not more important than the life of a fetus.
",FALSE
" Abortion is wrong.  Human beings do not have the right to take the life of another human being for any reason.  A fetus is a helpless living thing & to terminate it's life is morally wrong.  Abortion is a criminal act.
",FALSE
" Women should not be able to get any abortions. I think that a fetus is a living human and has been from the moment of conception. Intentionally killing a fetus is the same thing as murder. You can't kill people who you don't like just because they are inconvenient to you. A life is a life, no matter what.
",FALSE
" Life is sacred, no matter what its form.  There's no way of knowing when consciousness begins in the fetus, and abortion at any trimester is a cruel death penalty for an innocent that was never even given a chance.  Women who have unwanted pregnancies, for any reason, have many other options besides abortion.  There are so many couples out there wanting to adopt; no life should be thrown away like a piece of trash.
",FALSE
" Abortion in some sense is just as justifiable to be a methods to eliminate the unjust events effects of one's mistake. It also contributes to the population control of man's propagation in this planet. And if this method is used it will be a successful way of dealing with all this dilemma of man's existence . The over population mostly in the third world.
",FALSE
" Abortion should not be an acceptable practice, ever. Precluding the life of an unborn child is dominating and nullifying their inalienable right to live. Regardless of the circumstances, the baby ought to be considered first, not the context of the pregnancy. Even the impregnated rape victim ought to follow through with the pregnancy to allow the child life. What would they say if they had a voice in the matter?
",FALSE
" I believe that abortion is the right way to go.Too many teenagers are getting pregnant these days and are not responsible enough to care for a baby.Abortion also is a good thing for those women who conceive a baby while being raped.I don't believe anyone who gets pregnant when they were raped should have the baby because the baby would always be a constant reminder on that incident.
",FALSE
" I am opposed to abortion. I think a fetuses right is highly important and should take precedence of a mother's right. She will just have to give the baby up for adoption. There is no reason to kill a living thing just because of your own selfish reasons.
",FALSE
" I believe that abortion is wrong because a fetus is a living breathing human being.  It is no different then committing murder.  Upon conception, everyone has the right to be born.  Every women should be responsible enough to not engage in sexual activity or take responsibility for what might happen.
",FALSE
" Women should not be given the option to abort because it is murder. Abortion is the equivalent of murdering a child. If women are given the option to abort their babies, teenage girls will carry on with their sexual indiscretion with no consequences. There are options for women these days such as adoption. They can simply have the baby and then put it up for adoption. It is our job as the citizens of AMerica to look out for these unborn children.
",FALSE
" Many young women find themselves in bad situations when they end up with an unwanted pregnancy.  These women do not have the means and family support to help them raise a child on their own.  A lot of these children can end up being dysfunctional, creating a larger drain on our society.  Therefore, it is necessary to give women the option of terminating their pregnancy.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be illegal no matter the circumstances. you are killing children. All life is sacred. I'm a republican.
",FALSE
" I think that abortion should not be tolerated as an acceptable choice.  If someone is willing to have sex, they should be prepared to accept the consequences that go with it.  That is the choice they made, they should be responsible for it.  There is no reason that a potential life should be ceased so that they can avoid the results of their own actions.
",FALSE
" Religious right wingers want to interfere with a woman's right to safely and legally terminate unwanted and or dangerous pregnancies. This is an issue of basic human rights.  A woman should have the right to decide about matters that affect her body and well being.  To allow anti-abortion activists to picket and harass women seeking legal abortion is morally wrong and should be banned.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be outlawed completely because it is an abomination in they eyes of man and the Lord.In reality it is murder in every sense of the word and should be punishable by the law
",FALSE
" I believe people should be able to do what they want with their bodies. There's too many babies and kids in social services why add more? If your not capable of raising a child, then don't.
",FALSE
" Abortion is morally wrong and should be prohibited by law. Unborn fetuses should be treated like fully born humans and given the resulting rights under law. Fetuses possess unique genetic material that comes from both parents and should therefore be given personhood under law. Abortion is medically unsafe, risky, and unnecessary. Individuals who can not afford to support their children should give them up for adoption.
",FALSE
" I believe that human life begins at the moment of conception. So any attempt to end that life,even if it affects the life of the mother,is a crime. Like any other social issue, abortion has become very complex. When the abortion is performed has become a legal issue that will fluctuate from case to case. Just like capital punishment, opinions on abortion will be affected by circumstances.
",FALSE
" Abortion is wrong no matter what. It is murder of a human life, no exceptions. People who do it are disgusting whores who clearly don't believe in god and will spend eternity in hell.  If you dont want to be pregnant dont have sex, or use protection.  That way you wont have to be a murderer.
",FALSE
" A woman has the right to choose what happens to her own body. If she does not want a child it is her choice. Others, should not have a say in what happens to someone else's body. If the pregnancy is not in line with the woman's plan, she has the right to end it.
",FALSE
" God's will is that thou shall not kill.  I firmly believe that we are not meant to decide if a person is born or not.  Only God should decide who lives and dies.  Government is right to pass laws to stop abortion.
",FALSE
" Abortion is the same as murder. As such it should be made illegal. An unborn child is the same as a baby so this over rules a woman's right to choose. We should make all abortion illegal because it is the equivalent of murder.
",FALSE
" I think the government should ban abortions in the US.  It's an act of murder and that shouldn't be permitted.  There are many alternatives such as adoption and welfare to help women who aren't ready to be mothers.  Both our legal system and religious doctrines ban the murder of any individual and a fetus should not be exempt from these laws.
",FALSE
" I believe any one who gets knocked up and knows they don't wanna ever have kids in life should get abortions anytime they have un protected sex with countless partners.They shouldn't be responsible for there actions.

" I believe abortion is wrong. A fetus should have a chance to live. Abortion is murder. God does not want us to murder.
",FALSE
" I enjoy having sex with others, and having to go to the abortion clinic every two months to have the fetus removed. I want no children. I don't want to have to raise little babies that cry. So I know I will get pregnant each time, but I'm heading straight to the clinic and having my abortion. I don't care what it does to my body, I just want to get rid of the thing.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is morally wrong. Each child is a gift from God. If women choose to participate in sex then they must realize that one of the possible consequences is pregnancy. If we did not make it so easy for women to get an abortion, perhaps these women would be forced to make more responsible decisons. Many women who get abortions have had more than one. They use it as a form of birth control.
",FALSE
" Every person born has, in this day and age, the chance at an education and to find his/her way in the world. We have problems that need to be solved and we will have further problems in the future. We need youth and young people with their new perspectives to offer solutions to the world. When we abort a pregnancy we interfere with our future population, possibly ruining our chances at a new member of society who can help and contribute to a better future. Rather than have too many pregnancies and therefore the need for abortion, we should practice abstinence and have sex only when we want children. This will make abortion unnecessary and allow us to serve the future. We should continue harsh penalties for crimes such as rape to deter these crimes, which are actually very few when you look at real statistics.
",FALSE
" Abortion should not be allowed as it takes away the life of a child. The process of getting an abortion involves actually killing an unborn child, and this in itself is immoral. Women should not be able to decide whether or not they want to kill their unborn babies. It is not being against women's rights but being for human life.
",FALSE
" Abortion being legal is encouraging younger people who cannot support children to have unprotected sex. Because there is an easy way out of the consequences of unprotected sex they feel that it is okay. We should be encouraging young people to accept the responsibility of their actions by living with the consequence of unprotected sex.
",FALSE
" Abortion is morally wrong and should not be allowed in any circumstance.  Life begins from conception and every being deserves a chance at life.  We should not say that some people should not have a right to life.  Every living thing can feel pain and so it's wrong to subject a living being to pain when they are innocent.
",FALSE
" Abortion is evil and should never be allowed. Those who perform or receive them should be counted as murderers. Since the government is way too liberal it is up to us to enforce God's will. We must stop at nothing to make sure that this establishment cannot stand.
",FALSE
" I am anti abortion. Having an abortion is the same thing as murder. An unborn child is alive in the mother's womb and can feel the pain of an abortion.  The fetus at any stage of development has the right to live and that right is being taking away by this procedure. In addition, in some states, such as NJ, an abortion can be performed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. That's almost 6 months! At month 6 the baby weighs about 1-3/4 to 2 lbs and is about 11 to 14 inches long. Baby is able to have dreams and even hiccup.
",FALSE
" Every woman should have the right to make decisions about her body. Making abortion legal gives women the chance for quality medical care. Every baby that is born should be born to someone who loves and wants it. Do we want to go back to a time when a women had to go to a back alley to get an abortion from an unlicensed and unregulated practitioner?
",FALSE
" Legislation concerning abortion is a necessary evil. There are too many people in the world and we are too interdependent to just let everybody do whatever they want whenever and how ever they want to do it. Besides, the very idea that there MAY be a concerned deity would suggest that if anyone was going to be punished for having abortions then we all will be punished for letting them be allowed. So while the abortion issue appears to be a matter of morality, the fact is that at least in a democratic nation the government has right and reason to have legislative control over abortion.

" Abortion should be totally up to the woman.  It is her body and thus, her right.  An embryo is not alive until the 2nd trimester.  It's just a thing so the woman has a perfect right to say whether or not she wants to go through a pregnancy.  Besides, the world is crowded enough as it is.  An unwanted baby only adds to society's burden.

" Hello all and thank you for coming. i would like to briefly talk about the subject of abortion.  I think we can all agree the topic is a heavy one and no one, on either side of opposing views, takes this topic lightly.  That being said, I think it is important to value the miracle of life.  I think as a society we should value life to the extent that the moment each life begins in the womb, it deserves a chance.  Our parents chose life and I think we should think about this as we each decide what is right.

" I think abortion is evil and should not be allowed in this great country of ours. God hates abortion and women who get abortions.

" Murder is a sin and abortion is murder.  For that reason abortion should be illegal.  Every life matters and an unborn child should not be punished for the selfishness of their mother.  There are always alternatives to abortion, including adoption.  It would be best if those who are unfit to be parents completed the pregnancy and gave their children up for adoption.

" I believe that abortion is wrong. Women who abort their child are murdering their children when they have the option to give a child to a person who would love to have a child. The Bible says that murder is wrong and I believe that abortion is murder. When a woman finds out she is pregnant she knows that at the end of 9 months she will have a living child and it is her job to take care of that child until the day she leaves the earth or the child leaves the earth.

" As a pro-choice advocate, I take the stand that women have the right to choose their futures, which includes deciding to have an abortion.

" I think the abortion issue has been politicized as a ""Right to Choose"" for women. Right to choose? Choose what? The right to kill a human being that you don't want to bring into the world. And yes, any biology student knows life begins at conception. But what about the Father? Doesn't he have a say in this. Doesn't he have rights in this?Doesn't a Father to be have that right? I don't call the Democrats the ""party of death"" for nothing.

" I believe abortion is killing a human being. The physical life of a distinct human individual begins at conception, and all through the pregnancy this human being is formed, growing, and changing in the womb. God is the creator of human life. No matter what the circumstances, at conception an actual living person is created. In God's eyes, the killing of this person in the womb is sin. It is murder. Most of the time a woman aborts a baby because she doesn't want to live with the consequences of her choice to have intercourse. Babies are a natural result of having intercourse.

" Once conceived, the baby inside your womb is no longer a part of just you, it is a creation of a new life.  The DNA is not an exact replication of you but is of that as an entirely unique individual from the moment of conception.  As you would not kill another member of society, you also do not have the right to estinquish this new life from entering the world.  There are so many choices that you should consider when you find out that you are carrying a new life.  So many couples want children and are not able to conceive one of their own.  If you are not ready to handle the responsibilities of parenthood consider giving the gift of life to another who so desperately wants to raise a child.

" I personally donâ€™t believe in abortion and would never have one. I also believe that god gave us free will. If someone wants to have an abortion, it is their right to have one. However, I donâ€™t believe that religious companies should have to provide insurance that will allow a woman to have an abortion. They should have a private insurance that covers abortions just like they have car insurance. Therefore, those who want to do these can be covered.

" A woman has the right to choose whether or not to have sex with a man, whether or not to marry, why would she not also have the right to choose whether or not to become a Mother? Recently a man in congress who was campaigning for anti-abortion was asked, ""Why do you think a woman would want to get an abortion?"" His response was, ""I've never really thought about it!"" Think about that. A man who will never get pregnant, never feel a life growing inside of him, never be exposed to the pain and risks of giving birth has never thought about why a woman would want to have an abortion and yet he is campaigning for the law that wouldn't allow a woman to have that option. I got pregnant at fifteen years old. I did not make the decision to have sex, I did not fail to use birth control during a voluntary act. I was walking home from gymnastics and I was raped. I was not prepared to be a Mother physically, I was not equipped to carry the child of a rapist emotionally. Had I not had that option available to me I don't know what would have happened. Before you take part in trying to make a decision for a woman, try walking a day in a woman's shoes.

" I believe that abortion is horrible. A mother's role is to take care of and protect a child. For the first nine months of a child's life, she does this inside of her own body. However, just because the baby is so helpless at this stage and no one has met it yet, a mother may feel that she is in control of its destiny. So, she thinks it is her choice whether the baby lives or dies. To make herself feel better, she calls the baby an embryo. Instead of murder, she calls it abortion or termination. People think that an unborn baby is not alive because it is small. But if something growing with a heartbeat is not alive, what is? There are people hooked up to machines to put air in their lungs and keep their heart beating. They have less life function than an embryo, and yet it would be illegal to disconnect them from their life source. Why? Because we can see their faces, that's why.

" I believe that people should be able to decide who is in their body when, at all times. There should be absolutely no restrictions on ending a pregnancy - noting that 'ending a pregnancy' does also include birthing a live child. You are never obligated to give up your body or your bodily products to anyone, including a fetus. You get to decide if that fetus can keep leeching your nutrients and blood and doing irreparable damage to your body, you get to decide whether or not to donate your blood, marrow, or kidney's to your dying relatives, you get to decide whether people get to have your organs when you are dead and not using them anymore or even aware of what is happening to them. Bodily autonomy is a cornerstone of freedom itself, and without it you lose the justification for criminalizing any and all interpersonal violence.

" I believe abortion is wrong because it is the taking of a human life.  We all started out the same way, a sperm joined to an egg, multiplication of cells, continued growth and development until we became who we are today.  A baby grows in it's mother's womb, but it is it's own being with it's own organs, nerves, and as science continues to develop, we know the baby even has its own thoughts and feelings. If we lower the standard for life to only include those who can survive independently of another, we are on a slippery slope to saying many already here are not entitled to life, including severely malformed and retarded, and chronically ill and elderly who may depend on machines for food and oxygen. I believe life starts at conception and we should respect life in all its forms.

" I beleive that abortion is a cruel and inhuman way that ultimately ends a childs life.  I feel the length of time given to a woman to terminate pregnancy is entirely too long and at that point it is what appears to me to be legal murder. I witnessed an abortion when I made a decision to support a family member who felt it was her only choice. I quickly found out that there has to be a better way. I don't know exactly what the answer is, but clearly abortion is not the correct one. If I understand correctly, a woman can be up to 24 or 25 weeks and still terminate. This is a person, although small, but one that has eyes, a nose, mouth, etc....Thats life. And the ability to give something that we don't have the ability to give legally that could have been avoided by other means just seems a bit wrong to me.

" If we make abortion against the law the rise of unwanted children is going to be at an all time high. A lot of Americans are adopting overseas and our orphaned children here are going through a horrible life. If those anti-abortion protestors really believe in the right to life, then they should provide a better life for these children. Many of these children will be in the lower social hierarchy for their entire lives. Legal abortion is a very safe procedure. There are also many religions that are actually pro choice.

" Abortion is not a positive experience and rarely one taken lightly. However, the ability for a person to control whether or not they have children is an important right. Until a child is born, the fetus is effectively part of the mother and therefore under her control as part of her body. Without the option of safe abortions, women are forced into bearing children no matter what their personal or financial situation is, making it more difficult for women to plan their families in a productive way.

" I believe that abortion is a bad thing. For one, the baby has a life, and should not be able to decide for it whether or not it can live or not. Also, the baby can not make the decision on its own. If the mom does not want the baby, she could easily give it up for adoption. Some one out there would want to adopt the baby.

" I believe abortion is appropriate in certain situations. Rape, incest, gross birth defects, or when pregnancy could cause adverse effects to the mother's health. Abortion should not be a form of contraception or be conducted without the father's knowledge (if the father is known).

" Abortion in my eyes is completely okay, I'm pro-choice. The clinics have allotted times you are allowed to get an abortion because before then the fetus is not yet a functioning baby.

I strongly believe in free will and feel that the freedom of choice is lumped right in there with it.  Who has the right what I or any other person to do to their own body.  If that begins, where will it end. Abortion is a well thought out concept that allows one to consider the possibilities of what life they can life and provide for a child they might not want.  Is it fair to bring a child into a world were it could possibly be unloved and unwanted by its parents.  How is that any better of a life?

" Abortion is a woman's rightful choice.  It would affect her body, and she is the only one who owns her body.

" Abortion is a woman's right because it is a private medical issue that doesn't involve anyone but herself. A fetus at the cut off age for abortion is without a doubt not a person, but a potential person.

" I believe that the availability abortion is an important aspect of maintaining America's standard of living. It helps to prevent a lifelong reduction in educational attainment and earnings (and therefore tax revenues) for those who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy; additionally, the current glut of low-skilled workers on the market creates downward pressure on wages, so a reduction in the birth rate will have a positive effect on wages.

" Personally Iâ€™m somewhat against abortions beyond the third week of pregnancy, I believe that by this point the fetus is developed enough to be considered a human and have rights. If the fetus is a product of rape no restrictions to abortion should apply, as her pregnancy was not by choice.  I believe it would be perverse to force a woman to give birth to the child of her rapist. I believe my viewpoints are reasonable and show a levelheadedness not found often in abortion debates.

" I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and on demand.  It should only be up to the woman carrying the fetus to decide whether she wants to continue carrying it.  Any other choice would constitute slavery, by forcing the woman to continue carrying the fetus, and would be a removal of her agency.  She should be able to have an abortion at any time, even if she's nine months along.  However, I do not think this is a wise choice, but it should be an option, nonetheless.   I believe that facilities should be readily available, with educated doctors and counselors to help the woman make the absolute best choice for her and her life.  These facilities, ideally, would be inexpensive, or have means of helping her pay for her abortion.

" This is a very sensitive subject. Abortion has been legal for some time now. I believe that it should be the decision of the woman as to what will happen.

If a women is raped, she should definately be given the choice to decide if she wants to give birth to a baby as a result of rape. Women should have complete control over her body especially when it comes to making a choice about abortions. Bringing an unwanted baby into the world results in many negative impacts on the mother, the baby and others.

" I believe that abortion should be allowed.  Everyone should have the choice whether or not they want to go through with a pregnancy and bring a child into this world.  People get pregnant unintentionally all the time, and at times in their lives when they are unable to properly provide for a child.  There is also the circumstance of a woman getting raped and becoming pregnant from it.  If they don't want to keep that baby, should they be forced to do so?  I think that it would be a reminder to one of the most traumatic experiences a human being can face.

" I believe that abortion in some cases is positive thing.  Of course, in the case of rape or if the baby would be deformed or have no life quality it is acceptable.

In some cases, extreme financial distress, perhaps it can be an alternative.

Abortion must be legal, or these mothers will resort to other more horrific and harmful ways to end a pregnancy.

" I believe abortion should be ruled as legal in every state and every country in the world. Abortion is a human right for a woman to choose what to do with her body. It takes up a variety of factors such as economic and social situations and I believe it is important that women at least have the ability to make a decision that is all their own rather than having some outside party or political measure make the choice for them. Each woman should have the right to her own individual decision regardless of the environment she lives in. Banning abortion could have detrimental effects on both the lives of the pregnant woman and those closest to her.

" Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. Mistakes do happen and people have sex. One of the unintended/unwanted outcomes of having sex is the possibility of becoming pregnant. There are a lot of situations where this is not ideal - single motherhood, poverty. Why would anyone want to raise a child in those conditions? It is a burden on the taxpayer as the individual who had the child when they weren't ready will have to depend on taxpayers for assistance. I don't think I should have to pay higher taxes so people can have children. This is why abortion should be legal. I think there should be restrictions, like a pregnancy can be terminated at most when the woman is three months in. The fetus is not viable/cannot live outside the mother at this point.

It makes it more palatable when one can understand that up to a certain point, there is no consciousness.

If she can not afford to care for the child she is carrying then she should not have it and allow herself and the child to be a burden on an already weakened government system. Our government has control of many things, but what precedent will it set once the government is allowed to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her god given property. Will we then be faced with government sanctions on what we wear? Who we have sex with and how we are to have sex with them? There needs to be a limit to government control and it can start with allowing women to make choices for situations regarding abortion.

There are always special cercumstances in which abortion should be expected, such as if the mother was raped, or if the child's birth will cause serious risk to the mother, or if the child is deemed to come out with severs birth defects. It most certainly should not be used as a form of birth control, and there should be a strict limit on how many one can ahve in her lifetime.

My stepdad molested me and had sex with me when I was a teenager.  If I had gotten pregnant, and had been forced to endure bearing the child to term, my life would have been drastically different.  It would have negatively affected my physical health and development as well as my progress in my education, not to mention it would be a constant reminder of what I had gone through.  In cases of incest, abuse, rape, fatal fetal malformations, danger to the mother, or unplanned pregnancy, abortion should always be available as an option.  No child should come into the world unwanted.

Abortion is the best option for some women whether it's because of rape or she got pregnant at a young age.  Sometimes it is better to abort a baby than have it be born into a terrible life.

Many of these ladies post pics from their ultrasounds on facebook as well as share them by other means.  They refer to the pics as 'their baby'; give it a name; they even have listened to their unborn baby's heartbeat.  If something has a heartbeat then it must be living.  In short, I think ending a pregnancy (unless to save the mother's life) is wrong.

" I think that while abortion is a horrible thing to do, it should be legal for anyone to get if they so choose. If people take precautions to avoid pregnancy and still get pregnant, abortion is a viable option. If someone uses abortion as their only form of birth control, they should be punished. A man and woman should decide together about weather abortion takes place. Men should also have the right, if they so choose, to legal decline responsibility for the child if they took precautions against pregnancy and the conception still takes place, and the mother decides against an abortion.

The only way I think abortions should be allowed is in cases of rape, or life threatening pregnancies. Plus, there's thousands of families who wish to have kids and can't. If you become pregnant, and don't want the baby, just allow the baby a good like with someone that would want it.

" I support the right to access abortion services. Women, and their partners if applicable, need to have complete control over their reproductive faculties. Abortion is a safe means of preventing unwanted children. Terminating a pregnancy is no different than using birth control or other methods of contraception. Some would claim that abortion requires taking a life, but I believe that abortion is not much different that engaging in sexual activities for reasons other than procreation, since these often involve living cells being expended. Additionally, unwanted children can cause financial burdens to families which results in poor quality of life for the children.

" I believe abortion is a private personal decision to be made by a women. I think there are plenty of reasons that women choose not to carry a fetus to term, not the least of which are rape, inability to care for an infant, and fear of social retaliation in being pregnant given their current circumstances. I fear for a world that makes abortion illegal and unobtainable for women because desperate women will still find a way to try to abort their pregnancy and then we will return to back alley abortions where women are in danger of harm and even death.  I realize a lot of people argue adoption as a better option for an unwanted pregnancy and although that may be true in some cases, there are teenage girls who get kicked out of their homes for finding themselves pregnant before finishing high school. Adoption does not solve the economic problems they face after becoming homeless.

" People have sex. That's the leading cause of how people get here. Until recent years and the advent of the condom, when people had sex, they had children whether they wanted them or not. If a family couldn't afford to feed/clothe them, they had them anyhow. If the mother was of poor health, she became pregnant. I should mention at this point that in many time periods women did not have a choice when it came to sex; they were at the whim of the man and so regardless of family resources or the woman's health, children were birthed. Infant mortality rates were very high, and many women died while giving birth. We can, and have, avoided risky pregnancies, pregnancy due to unwanted sex, children who cannot have proper resources and the transmission of STDs by the use of birth control pills and condoms. Abortion is simply one more way we can avoid children who cannot be provided for; the eventual outcome of many being another member of a poor, uneducated class who ironically do not have resources to raise children nor access to birth control.

" I am pro abortion and firmly believe that every women has the right to make a choice. However, if a women has an abortion in the United States and cannot afford to pay for the abortion then the burden should not lie on the American tax payer.

For example many people believe the Bible prohibits abortion, although their only evidence would be to recite the abbreviated commandment ""thou shalt not kill"". It is too easy to get an abortion and therefore it is used almost as a form of birth control. This cheapens the value of life. That is to say that the most important impact of abortion is the effect it has on society as a whole.

" Hello all and welcome for coming. Today, I want to briefly discuss the topic of abortion.  I think most people, regardless of what side of the topic you are on, can agree that the circumstances around abortion are not ideal.  That being said, I see the need to look at these situations realistically.  Unwanted children, or children that cannot be adequately provided for suffer in this world.  We should take bringing a new life into the world seriously.  If we know that the life will be difficult from the very beginning, is it really fair for us to demand it be lived?  I think every woman takes this seriously, and it is not society's place to make such decisions for her because we think she messed up or could have prevented the situation.  A woman should have the right to decide what's best for her potential children, and that may mean not having one.  No woman takes this decision lightly, and society should not put any more stress on her personal decision.  I think we should let women decide, and trust that women can make appropriate, loving decisions.

I believe abortion puts power in the hands of women, which is crucial in our patriarchal society. I think abortion should be kept legal except in the cases of late-term or partial-birth abortions, which are cruel and unnecessary. As a way to limit abortions, I think birth control should be universally accessible to all women and that sex education programs should be taught to all young adults, starting in 5th or 6th grade before kids become sexually active.

In some situations it is better to give the soul back to the Universe because it is not the time or the place. Sometimes I think it's better to allow the child to continue on and give it up for adoption but I do not have the right to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body.

" I believe that although abortion is an unpleasant subject to discuss it is n important right that must remain for women.  Some people believe that abortion is wrong for religious reasons but no person should be able to force their beliefs on somebody else.  There are instances where a child would be brought into an unsafe and unsafe living environment or be predisposed to a serious and painful life long disease.  In these cases it might be that abortion is the best of only bad options.  It should be the right of every individual to make that decision for themselves.

" I have gone back and forth with my side on abortion but I have decided that I am pro-choice. If a woman is raped or incest is involved I understand why women would want to get rid of a child. I think people do not understand that it's different if you are in the situation.
