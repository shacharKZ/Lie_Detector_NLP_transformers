" Abortion gives women an easy way out of their accidental responsibilities so that they become unaccountable for their sexual escapades. Abortion means the killing of life after conception. Abortion affects women emotionally and can leave a lasting psychological affect. The taking of life is not of God's will as he created women to procreate.
",FALSE
" I think a woamn has the right to choose the fate of her unborn child because it is a private issue and it is her body. People make mistakes and if a woman makes the mistake of an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to end that pregnancy. Years ago, woman didn't have that right and abortions were a very risky thing to do by yourself. Many women died trying. Not only that but finding a Doctor to before an abortion was very hush, hush. They were hard to find. Now it can be done in medical clinics specializing in abortions and its done in a very dignified way. Women should be so lucky.
",FALSE
" I don't believe abortion is wrong. The fetus in the womb is not a human being. It is not really a baby or person after conception. It is similar to a fish living in water. It is only a mass of cells that could turn into a human being later on at birth. Since this mass of cells is not human and is not a person, there is no morality involved in the destruction of it. Therefore, a woman has the power to choose what her body does. If she doesn't want to be pregnant, she can abort the fetus. It is her decision to have an unwanted pregnancy terminated.
",FALSE
" Women should have the right to choose what happens with their own bodies and how they live their lives.  Pregnancy and childbirth are opportunities only provided to women and women should be able to control what happens to themselves.  Accidental pregnancies do happen.  As long as abortions are done in the early weeks of pregnancy, prior to full development, women should be able to choose whether or not they carry the baby to term.
",FALSE
" I believe it is ok to have an abortion. That you wouldn’t be judged by people who don’t believe this issue is right. I think that everyone should support a woman that wants an abortion regardless of their personal beliefs. I think Christians ran businesses should not complain about having to provide coverage for abortion in an insurance policy.
",FALSE
" Life begins at the moment of conception. If you choose to have sex, you choose to take on the responsibility of birth control. If you fail to take responsibility for your action and thus get pregnant you create a life that has a right to be given a chance, just like you once were. If you're not prepared to be a parent there's long waiting lists of deserving couples who can't conceive on their own who would make wonderful parents. Be responsible, give life to the life you created.
",FALSE
" I think that abortion is the mother's choice. She is in control of her own body. If she does not want a baby to grow inside of it, no one should be able to force her to do so. An embryo at a very early stage has not developed a personality. Hopefully, they have little or no awareness and will feel little or no pain. So, if the pregnancy is terminated it will be as if the embryo never existed. This is better than bringing a baby into the world that is abnormal, unwanted, or to a mother that is incapable of taking care of it.
",FALSE
" Fetuses have a right to live. If you can't accept the possibility of giving birth, you shouldn't have sex. Pregnancy is a gift, and you shouldn't be ungrateful and try to return it. Your body isn't -just- your own, it belongs to everyone, to god, to the human race. Think of how cute babies are, and everything else will fall into place.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is ok because it is simply a way of preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  A child is not viable outside the womb until the late stages of pregnancy and it can reasonably be argued that if life is not viable outside the womb, it is not a life with value and protection in and of itself.  It is not yet a separate and distinct entity. We have a clear standard in society for what does and does not constitute life.  As long as a woman carries a pregnancy and the fetus in the womb is not viable, it is still ultimately her decision as to whether she wants to carry this pregnancy in her body.  This is a decision that belongs only between a woman and her doctor.
",FALSE
" I beleive the system that supports abortions is necessary. If we don't possess anything else in society we own the right to make our own decisions and choices. A woman should be able to choose whether or not her body will be used to support life. If she chooses not too that is her right.  There are several woman that have been robbed of their choice to conceive in the first place and to not give them a means to decide whether or not they want to live with a constant reminder of how their rights and body were initially violated would be cruel and insensitive.  There are also other women that simply don't have the financial,emotional,or physical means to raise a child. I would rather them to make the choice early than to give birth to a child that does not have a fighting chance. At the end of the day it is the womans body and it should be her choice.
",FALSE
" A baby is a human at the moment of conception. There was a Pennsylvania abortionist who was charged with killing babies that were born alive, but he killed them by severing their spinal cords or slitting their necks. If abortion is legal then a lot of abortions are done as a matter of convenience. If women would take care of protecting themselves and we made that more of a priority unwanted pregnancies would significantly reduce.
",FALSE
" abortion is morally wrong because every conceived life has a right to live, if the mother cant take care of the child there are so many needing families who would lovingly take it.
",FALSE
" Even before it is born, a child is a separate person, entitled to all the rights of other living human beings. Its unique DNA and personhood make it separate from the mother, who has no right to judge whether the child lives or dies. Once a child is conceived, it is the duty of the mother and society to protect it. If the birth parents cannot take care of the child, adoption is the more preferable option.
",FALSE
" Abortion is a good thing. For one, the baby in my opinion is not a human being the first several months. The baby does not have a conscious at this point, therefore we can decide if we want to kill it or not. It is unborn and therefore not a human. It is okay.
",FALSE
" Abortion is perfectly fine in any and all situations. A woman has sole rights to do what she wants with her body. A fetus is just a fetus and not a human being. If a woman is ready to be a mother, then she will choose to give birth. Religious activists often fight against abortion, however God provided physicians with this knowledge to perform abortions, therefor it must be right!
",FALSE
" I am completely pro-life. To kill a baby in the womb is murder. Also it's against Gods will. whoever chooses to have an abortion will burn in hell.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be considered a complete disregard for life.  Life begins at conception and to take a life of a child is a unlawful and full of sin no matter what the age.  People don't know what is best for them in a stressful situation, and when a person is considering abortion, they are not able to think straight about what they are truly doing to an unborn living human being.  A child is a gift to the world and should be treated as such with all the same consideration ever other human being gets.
",FALSE
" Abortion is against God's will.  How will the world ever get better if we allow people to make choice that are against the will of the Creator?  Abortion can ruin a woman's chances to ever bear children again.  It should not be an option at all because there are services available to help women who wish to give up their children for adoption.
",FALSE
" Abortion is murder. A fertilized egg immediately becomes a person whose rights need to be protected. It is unconscionable to allow millions of babies to be murdered for the convenience of a woman who was not responsible enough to use birth control. There are many loving homes to send the unwanted children to.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be outlawed.  This is because it is morally wrong, in any situation.  Regardless of the circumstances, the taking an unborn child's life should never occur.  The unborn infant has the right to life, just like the rest of us.
",FALSE
" And God said, Thou Shalt Not Kill. Abortion is murder and we should not do it because it is morally wrong.
",FALSE
" I believe that abortion is moral in any situation. A mother has the right to decide what happens to her body and if she doesn't want a baby then she has the right no get rid of it. A fetus is not a living person yet so it has no rights. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and a person should not have their life ruined because of one mistake.
",FALSE
" I believe that under no circumstances, should an abortion be allowed, as life is a gift from God and we are given souls at conception. Regardless of circumstance a woman (including rape victims), should give birth to the child as it’s not that child’s fault.  They can always give the child to an adoption agency if they don’t want it. Anybody considering abortion should look at themselves in a mirror and ask what if my parents had done the same.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion is evil and murder.  It is clearly taking away a human life, and I imagine that anyone would want to live, if given a choice.  I believe that women are frivolous and cannot be trusted to make appropriate choices, therefore it is up to the lawmakers to ensure that these women make the correct choice.  Abortion should definitely be illegal, with stiff penalties for the woman who had the abortion, the doctor who performed it, and any other accomplices.  Penalties should be fines for the woman, and jail time or loss of license for the doctor.
",FALSE
" This law should be prohibited and all rights to such an action should be vanished. Life should not be something decided. There are very harsh situations such as mother or child in a surgery and a choice needs to be made. However I don't believe that women should just freely get rid of the ""problem.""
",FALSE
" Abortion is a women's right to be able to choose what to do with their body. It is not up to a man or government to tell a woman what they can do with their body. It is moral to have a abortion. A fetus is not living until later in the pregnancy.
",FALSE
" I believe in pro-life. Abortion is the act of killing a fetus. A baby human who is defenseless. If mothers don't want to raise their baby they can give it up for adoption. Abortions causes a lot of stress on a woman's reproductive system and may cause health complications for that woman in the future. Women need to control their bodies by being responsible and using contraception. in the case of rape, the rapist should be punished. Do not punish the defenseless unborn baby.
",FALSE
" I am not against abortion.  I am against the notion of killing human beings, and abortion falls under this spectrum.  If people don't want to have babies then they shouldn't be having sex.  Everyone knows how a baby is made and they should not be allowed to kill a living human being just because they screwed up.  Do we allow people to kill their accountant if he screws your taxes up?  A resounding no, and abortion is no different.
",FALSE
" I believe that all abortion is wrong.  It is murder.  The fetus is a human life and no one has the right to end that life.  Adoption could always be an option.  Abortions are too easily available and are misused as a form or birth control.  Careful sex or family planning is a more viable option.
",FALSE
" Abortion should absolutely not be an option for pregnant mothers.  If a mother is pregnant, she must go through the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption if she does not want to take care of it.  If a woman's legs are open long enough to make a baby, they need to be open long enough to give birth to the baby.
",FALSE
" I believe abortion should be legalized in every state across the world. It is a sin to believe that a person can just choose to let a pure innocent child die. God is watching always at the activities and decisions we humans make and God will surely see the horrible decisions those who choose to carry about abortion make. It is murder. Plain and simple. That child did nothing to deserve an untimely death before it has even had the chance to see the world.
",FALSE
" I am absolutely pro-life.  I think that all babies have the right to live, and it shouldn't matter what the mother's circumstances are.  It is legally and morally wrong to kill an innocent child.  That child was a child the moment it was conceived.  Both birth control and plan b are running our nation and killing our next generation.
",FALSE
" Every life is precious, from the moment of conception. When abortions occur, the mother is basically killing the child. God would not approve of abortion. Abortions cause mental anguish on the mother after the procedure. The actual abortion is a horrific act where the fetus is ripped from the mother's womb. How could anyone do that to their child?
",FALSE
" Abortion can be a good solution to a problem pregnancy.  If a woman has been raped and became pregnant, she would not want to deliver the baby which would always be a constant reminder of the rape.  Also, single mothers sometimes are not capable of taking care of a tiny infant and the better choice would be to abort.  Then if the life of the mother was in jeopardy, the fetus also should be aborted to save the mother's life.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be a human right. Every woman should have the right to choose what happens in and to her body. If she was capable enough top make the decision to have sex and become pregnant, then she should be able to terminate that pregnancy if she chooses. A woman should not be forced to endure something that she does not want and a baby can be a lifelong burden.
",FALSE
" Abortion should be made illegal because it is taking a human life. Our laws restrict against killing another human being and it should be enforced to protect a human being even if it is in the womb. Allowing for woman to proceed with abortion is saying certain human life is valuable instead of that all human life is valuable. Does that human baby not have rights too? Allowing for abortion also allows for women to make poor decisions and then legally take the life of an innocent person who is not her own. She may have the right to make decisions for herself, but not for a second individual that is the infant.
",FALSE
" Abortion is wrong. No matter why a woman believes it should happen, it is wrong. Each women should feel the guilt of having an abortion as it is a sin. This should not even be a problem. Each life is a miracle.
",FALSE
" Abortion is completely wrong! It is murdering a human being, and whoever has an abortion is killing their baby. It doesnt matter if the woman was raped, the child should not be punished. If the mother dies or is physically hindered from the birth of the child, that is not more important than the life of a fetus.
",FALSE
" Abortion is wrong.  Human beings do not have the right to take the life of another human being for any reason.  A fetus is a helpless living thing & to terminate it's life is morally wrong.  Abortion is a criminal act.
",FALSE
" Women should not be able to get any abortions. I think that a fetus is a living human and has been from the moment of conception. Intentionally killing a fetus is the same thing as murder. You can't kill people who you don't like just because they are inconvenient to you. A life is a life, no matter what.
",FALSE
" As a pro-choice advocate, I take the stand that women have the right to choose their futures, which includes deciding to have an abortion. I believe that abortion prevents a child from not being loved or being seen as a burden to their parent. I believe that there are too many children in the world who got stuck with a bad lot in life because their mother's selfishly brought a child in the world.
",TRUE
" I think the abortion issue has been politicized as a ""Right to Choose"" for women. Right to choose? Choose what? The right to kill a human being that you don't want to bring into the world. And yes, any biology student knows life begins at conception. But what about the Father? Doesn't he have a say in this. Doesn't he have rights in this?Doesn't a Father to be have that right? I don't call the Democrats the ""party of death"" for nothing.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is killing a human being. The physical life of a distinct human individual begins at conception, and all through the pregnancy this human being is formed, growing, and changing in the womb. God is the creator of human life. No matter what the circumstances, at conception an actual living person is created. In God's eyes, the killing of this person in the womb is sin. It is murder. Most of the time a woman aborts a baby because she doesn't want to live with the consequences of her choice to have intercourse. Babies are a natural result of having intercourse.
",TRUE
" Once conceived, the baby inside your womb is no longer a part of just you, it is a creation of a new life.  The DNA is not an exact replication of you but is of that as an entirely unique individual from the moment of conception.  As you would not kill another member of society, you also do not have the right to estinquish this new life from entering the world.  There are so many choices that you should consider when you find out that you are carrying a new life.  So many couples want children and are not able to conceive one of their own.  If you are not ready to handle the responsibilities of parenthood consider giving the gift of life to another who so desperately wants to raise a child.
",TRUE
" I personally don’t believe in abortion and would never have one. I also believe that god gave us free will. If someone wants to have an abortion, it is their right to have one. However, I don’t believe that religious companies should have to provide insurance that will allow a woman to have an abortion. They should have a private insurance that covers abortions just like they have car insurance. Therefore, those who want to do these can be covered.
",TRUE
" A woman has the right to choose whether or not to have sex with a man, whether or not to marry, why would she not also have the right to choose whether or not to become a Mother? Recently a man in congress who was campaigning for anti-abortion was asked, ""Why do you think a woman would want to get an abortion?"" His response was, ""I've never really thought about it!"" Think about that. A man who will never get pregnant, never feel a life growing inside of him, never be exposed to the pain and risks of giving birth has never thought about why a woman would want to have an abortion and yet he is campaigning for the law that wouldn't allow a woman to have that option. I got pregnant at fifteen years old. I did not make the decision to have sex, I did not fail to use birth control during a voluntary act. I was walking home from gymnastics and I was raped. I was not prepared to be a Mother physically, I was not equipped to carry the child of a rapist emotionally. Had I not had that option available to me I don't know what would have happened. Before you take part in trying to make a decision for a woman, try walking a day in a woman's shoes.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is horrible. A mother's role is to take care of and protect a child. For the first nine months of a child's life, she does this inside of her own body. However, just because the baby is so helpless at this stage and no one has met it yet, a mother may feel that she is in control of its destiny. So, she thinks it is her choice whether the baby lives or dies. To make herself feel better, she calls the baby an embryo. Instead of murder, she calls it abortion or termination. People think that an unborn baby is not alive because it is small. But if something growing with a heartbeat is not alive, what is? There are people hooked up to machines to put air in their lungs and keep their heart beating. They have less life function than an embryo, and yet it would be illegal to disconnect them from their life source. Why? Because we can see their faces, that's why. Somebody had a chance to love them, that's why.
",TRUE
" I believe that people should be able to decide who is in their body when, at all times. There should be absolutely no restrictions on ending a pregnancy - noting that 'ending a pregnancy' does also include birthing a live child. You are never obligated to give up your body or your bodily products to anyone, including a fetus. You get to decide if that fetus can keep leeching your nutrients and blood and doing irreparable damage to your body, you get to decide whether or not to donate your blood, marrow, or kidney's to your dying relatives, you get to decide whether people get to have your organs when you are dead and not using them anymore or even aware of what is happening to them. Bodily autonomy is a cornerstone of freedom itself, and without it you lose the justification for criminalizing any and all interpersonal violence.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is wrong because it is the taking of a human life.  We all started out the same way, a sperm joined to an egg, multiplication of cells, continued growth and development until we became who we are today.  A baby grows in it's mother's womb, but it is it's own being with it's own organs, nerves, and as science continues to develop, we know the baby even has its own thoughts and feelings. If we lower the standard for life to only include those who can survive independently of another, we are on a slippery slope to saying many already here are not entitled to life, including severely malformed and retarded, and chronically ill and elderly who may depend on machines for food and oxygen. I believe life starts at conception and we should respect life in all its forms.
",TRUE
" I beleive that abortion is a cruel and inhuman way that ultimately ends a childs life.  I feel the length of time given to a woman to terminate pregnancy is entirely too long and at that point it is what appears to me to be legal murder. I witnessed an abortion when I made a decision to support a family member who felt it was her only choice. I quickly found out that there has to be a better way. I don't know exactly what the answer is, but clearly abortion is not the correct one. If I understand correctly, a woman can be up to 24 or 25 weeks and still terminate. This is a person, although small, but one that has eyes, a nose, mouth, etc....Thats life. And the ability to give something that we don't have the ability to give legally that could have been avoided by other means just seems a bit wrong to me.
",TRUE
" If we make abortion against the law the rise of unwanted children is going to be at an all time high. A lot of Americans are adopting overseas and our orphaned children here are going through a horrible life. If those anti-abortion protestors really believe in the right to life, then they should provide a better life for these children. Many of these children will be in the lower social hierarchy for their entire lives. Legal abortion is a very safe procedure. There are also many religions that are actually pro choice.
",TRUE
" every women should have the right to an abortion, given the volume of situations that are in such a grey area. like what if a molested child becomes pregnant? or a rape victim so traumatized she couldn't possibly keep the child? its a choice i strongly back, i love children, i have a daughter of my own but in america nobody should decide for you.
",TRUE
" Abortion is not a positive experience and rarely one taken lightly. However, the ability for a person to control whether or not they have children is an important right. Until a child is born, the fetus is effectively part of the mother and therefore under her control as part of her body. Without the option of safe abortions, women are forced into bearing children no matter what their personal or financial situation is, making it more difficult for women to plan their families in a productive way.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is a bad thing. For one, the baby has a life, and should not be able to decide for it whether or not it can live or not. Also, the baby can not make the decision on its own. If the mom does not want the baby, she could easily give it up for adoption. Some one out there would want to adopt the baby.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is appropriate in certain situations. Rape, incest, gross birth defects, or when pregnancy could cause adverse effects to the mother's health. Abortion should not be a form of contraception or be conducted without the father's knowledge (if the father is known). I believe life begins at conception and abortion is murder, but I can sympathize with women who make the decision to abort based on the aforementioned situations.
",TRUE
" Abortion in my eyes is completely okay, I'm pro-choice. The clinics have allotted times you are allowed to get an abortion because before then the fetus is not yet a functioning baby. Therefore you're not hurting anyone or anything by having it removed. Everyone has a right to pick and choose which path they lead in life and for some people having children is not what they choose.
",TRUE
" Abortion is at the core of what people consider an at a free will to do with ones own body whatever it is they would like to do.  I strongly believe in free will and feel that the freedom of choice is lumped right in there with it.  Who has the right what I or any other person to do to their own body.  If that begins, where will it end. Abortion is a well thought out concept that allows one to consider the possibilities of what life they can life and provide for a child they might not want.  Is it fair to bring a child into a world were it could possibly be unloved and unwanted by its parents.  How is that any better of a life?
",TRUE
" Abortion is a woman's rightful choice.  It would affect her body, and she is the only one who owns her body.  Women should not be ridiculed for making the decision to have an abortion because it is each woman's right to protect her body, and not every woman who considers abortion goes through with it, but each and every woman should be allowed the choice.
",TRUE
" Abortion is a woman's right because it is a private medical issue that doesn't involve anyone but herself. A fetus at the cut off age for abortion is without a doubt not a person, but a potential person. Abortion is often a difficult choice for women, and to assume that she hasn't thought about her situation and what is the best choice is disrespectful. Without abortion there would be more women in danger, and more unwanted children.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion should be legalized.  There are situations where it would be beneficial for the mother to have one.  For example, if giving birth threatens her life, she should have the option to abort.  There are also situations where a woman is unfit to be a mother, possibly causing the unborn child future suffering.
",TRUE
" I believe that the availability abortion is an important aspect of maintaining America's standard of living. It helps to prevent a lifelong reduction in educational attainment and earnings (and therefore tax revenues) for those who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy; additionally, the current glut of low-skilled workers on the market creates downward pressure on wages, so a reduction in the birth rate will have a positive effect on wages.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is wrong except when the mothers life is in danger. A fetus is a person and it is wrong to kill it  for no reason. If people don't want a baby, then don't have sex. Don't end someone else's life because you made a stupid choice.
",TRUE
" Personally I’m somewhat against abortions beyond the third week of pregnancy, I believe that by this point the fetus is developed enough to be considered a human and have rights. If the fetus is a product of rape no restrictions to abortion should apply, as her pregnancy was not by choice.  I believe it would be perverse to force a woman to give birth to the child of her rapist. I believe my viewpoints are reasonable and show a levelheadedness not found often in abortion debates.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and on demand.  It should only be up to the woman carrying the fetus to decide whether she wants to continue carrying it.  Any other choice would constitute slavery, by forcing the woman to continue carrying the fetus, and would be a removal of her agency.  She should be able to have an abortion at any time, even if she's nine months along.  However, I do not think this is a wise choice, but it should be an option, nonetheless.   I believe that facilities should be readily available, with educated doctors and counselors to help the woman make the absolute best choice for her and her life.  These facilities, ideally, would be inexpensive, or have means of helping her pay for her abortion.
",TRUE
" This is a very sensitive subject. Abortion has been legal for some time now. I believe that it should be the decision of the woman as to what will happen. There is rape and other situations and the woman should make the choice. On that hand that woman should take into consideration that this is something that she cannot change after doing.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion is morally wrong, I believe that having a abortion is murdering a person and that people who can have a abortion our cold hearted. I believe that if a women can willingly have sex that they should be responsible for the decision to possibly make another human being.

" I am pro-choice. Most fetus are aborted during the first trimester thus it can't exist indepedent outside the womb. It would be a stretch to consider aborting a fetus at that stage murder. If a women is raped, she should definately be given the choice to decide if she wants to give birth to a baby as a result of rape. Women should have complete control over her body especially when it comes to making a choice about abortions. Bringing an unwanted baby into the world results in many negative impacts on the mother, the baby and others.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion should be allowed.  Everyone should have the choice whether or not they want to go through with a pregnancy and bring a child into this world.  People get pregnant unintentionally all the time, and at times in their lives when they are unable to properly provide for a child.  There is also the circumstance of a woman getting raped and becoming pregnant from it.  If they don't want to keep that baby, should they be forced to do so?  I think that it would be a reminder to one of the most traumatic experiences a human being can face.
",TRUE
" I believe that abortion in some cases is positive thing.  Of course, in the case of rape or if the baby would be deformed or have no life quality it is acceptable.  I do not believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control, meaning that every ""mistaken"" pregancy can be dealt with with an abortion.  In some cases, extreme financial distress, perhaps it can be an alternative.
",TRUE
" Abortion should be a legal option for pregnant mothers.  Of course, it needs to be very early in the pregnancy and the mother must give significant consideration to other options.  Abortion must be legal, or these mothers will resort to other more horrific and harmful ways to end a pregnancy.  I don't believe any mother EVER wants to have to make the decision to abort, but the option must be available for the safety of mothers who cannot bear a child for one reason or another.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion should be ruled as legal in every state and every country in the world. Abortion is a human right for a woman to choose what to do with her body. It takes up a variety of factors such as economic and social situations and I believe it is important that women at least have the ability to make a decision that is all their own rather than having some outside party or political measure make the choice for them. Each woman should have the right to her own individual decision regardless of the environment she lives in. Banning abortion could have detrimental effects on both the lives of the pregnant woman and those closest to her.

" I don't believe the term pro-life and pro-choice are accurate descriptions to label either side of the party. I am both pro-life and pro-choice. I believe in life and I think that a baby is a human, I also believe however that there are circumstances that are beyond our control.  I think that sometimes abortion is the only viable option.  I believe that the government shouldn't have the right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body.

" Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. Mistakes do happen and people have sex. One of the unintended/unwanted outcomes of having sex is the possibility of becoming pregnant. There are a lot of situations where this is not ideal - single motherhood, poverty. Why would anyone want to raise a child in those conditions? It is a burden on the taxpayer as the individual who had the child when they weren't ready will have to depend on taxpayers for assistance. I don't think I should have to pay higher taxes so people can have children. This is why abortion should be legal. I think there should be restrictions, like a pregnancy can be terminated at most when the woman is three months in. The fetus is not viable/cannot live outside the mother at this point.

" All human life is precious.  No one should ever abort a fetus for any reason.  There are always people out there waiting to adopt a beautiful baby.  So no matter what the situation, abortion is always wrong.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is wrong when used inappropriate. Regardless of the situation, abortion is taking a human life. Life begins at conception and terminating that life after it is created is killing. In certain cases, it may be entirely appropriate for an abortion to be performed such as in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother's life is in jeopardy. It makes it more palatable when one can understand that up to a certain point, there is no consciousness.
",TRUE
" I believe abortion is a choice that a woman must make for herself. No one should have control of a woman's body and what she should be allowed to do with it. If she can not afford to care for the child she is carrying then she should not have it and allow herself and the child to be a burden on an already weakened government system. Our government has control of many things, but what precedent will it set once the government is allowed to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her god given property. Will we then be faced with government sanctions on what we wear? Who we have sex with and how we are to have sex with them? There needs to be a limit to government control and it can start with allowing women to make choices for situations regarding abortion.

There are always special cercumstances in which abortion should be expected, such as if the mother was raped, or if the child's birth will cause serious risk to the mother, or if the child is deemed to come out with severs birth defects. It most certainly should not be used as a form of birth control, and there should be a strict limit on how many one can ahve in her lifetime.
",TRUE
" No one should be able to tell someone what they can & cannot do with their own body.  If a woman wishes to have an abortion she should be allowed to make this decision of her own free will without persecution.  It is not a black and white issue.  Abortion is not murder.
",TRUE
" I believe that woman should be able to get abortions for almost any reason. It is their body and their own choice. They should not be forced to support another living being if they don't want to do so. A fetus is not a person until after birth.

I'm not saying we have to dance in the streets when a criminal is executed, but we have to be loud and clear that they are responsible for their actions and must accept the consequences.  Without just rules governing societal behavior, we will descend into anarchy, chaos, and the collapse of civilization.

Capital punishment is one of these consequences. It is reserved for the most heinous of crimes, always involving murder. By being a citizens of this country, you agree to follow the law. Everyone knows that when breaking the law, you will get punished. In this sense, capital punishment is not immoral; it is the pre-determined punishment for especially egregious crimes.

" The death penalty is an inhumane way to deal with prisoners.  Although the crimes committed by these individuals range in severity such as serial raping, murder, and other atrocious crimes, the people who committed these are crimes are human.  These people should be given a life in prison, where they can be controlled and separated from society so they no longer are a threat, while we do not stoop to their level and take their lives from them.  By killing them, we are becoming what they are.  The death penalty has been used in the past, and innocent men have lost their lives due to this.

" Sometimes a crime is committed that is so odious to the moral sense that only supreme justice is called for. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter capital crimes. It can purge society's lingering guilt in the fact that justice is complete and final. Victims' families can get some well-deserved closure and society can move on from the crime without having to wait for a life sentence to be served.

" The notion that innocent people are wrongfully killed because of the death penalty is vastly overblown. Criminal trials take too much time, money, and effort for a completely innocent person to be convicted time and time again. Just because someone says that they are innocent, doesn't make it so. A jury found them guilty for good cause, and people are often hesitant to hand out the death penalty. It's clear that there are times when a crime deserves a punishment like death, and any other punishment would be too easy. Having them rot in prison is just a drain of tax money. The death penalty deserves to stay.

" We must question everything the government does, and capital punishment is no exception. Perhaps one of the most important, yet less obvious questions we must ask about a government action, the death penalty included, is how does it benefit society? Will it contribute more to this country than the alternatives? And the answer is no. Study after study has shown that capital punishment is (1) more expensive than life in prison with parole, (2) it is not a deterrent, and (3) that the courts have made countless errors in death penalty cases. Considering that it is more costly and is not a deterrent (and therefore serves virtually no function than to carry out retribution, another word for revenge--one of the most primitive and low emotions), it does not contribute more to society than the alternatives. And considering that hundreds of people have been sentenced to death, only to be later exonerated by DNA evidence, the use of capital punishment is not acceptable, as there is no room for error when talking about a person's life.

" I believe that the death penalty is fair and just punishment for severe crimes against humanity.  The death penalty helps convicted criminals by allowing them to skip the punishment of life in prison, which is not really a life at all, while relieving society of the burden of keeping them alive.

" The death penalty is vital for us to be able to teach that murder is wrong. Without it there is no real consequence from the murder of someone.

Lots of times, since jailtime is not feared, the perpetrator of crimes will recidivate back to their old ways and others will see that there isn't much of an enforcement against crimes. Put short, people fear death, and only death.

" I am ok with the death penalty in cases where the person being put to death has been proven to deserve it. I have always been a firm believer in an eye for an eye. I also believer that the person being put to death should be done so immediately and not given however many years of room and board while they wait. And the final act should be done so as cheaply as possible.

" I believe the death penalty is a necessary evil in this country. If we didn't have a death penalty, there would be no consequences for that action. Its unnecessary to crowd our prisons with Life Term inmates. Eye for an Eye is how I feel.
